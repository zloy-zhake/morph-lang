The President noted that our country stood for soonest stabilization in Kyrgyzstan and was ready to provide all-round assistance to the neighbor state.
Kazakhstan wishes stability to Kyrgyzstan.
Being the President of the country presiding in the OSCE I make every effort to provide humanitarian and other aid to the Kyrgyz Republic.
Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan have already helped Kyrgyzstan within the CSTO.
I think Uzbekistan faces no less difficult situation presently.
We should express gratitude to President Islam Karimov and Uzbekistan for their efforts.
Nearly 100 thousand refugees have arrived in the country to date; all of them must be accommodated and provided with food, clothes and medical care.
I can imagine how many problems Uzbekistan has to solve today.
We - Kazakhstan, Russia and Uzbekistan - together help Kyrgyzstan.
There is an opinion that Kyrgyzstan is a poor country which can not achieve success.
I do not agree with this statement.
Kyrgyzstan is rich in gold, iron, silver, copper and other resources.
The country possesses huge potential for development of tourism.
All of these sectors must be developed.
Humanitarian aid cannot help raise any country.
The first question is whether the country is able to raise economy, provide its people with jobs.
This is the only condition of the country's stability.
Therefore a special program of Kyrgyzstan's economic revival must be developed and Kazakhstan is ready to help in its elaboration.
I sincerely wish Kyrgyzstan to have its own strategy of revival and economic growth, the President stressed.

Remarks by President Nursultan Nazarbayev at the International Conference Titled From a Nuclear Test Ban to a Nuclear Weapon-Free World
speeches and addresses
Dear friends!
Today the world has been marking for the third time the observation of the International Day against Nuclear Tests.
The Day was established by the UN General Assembly resolution, which was presented at the initiative of Kazakhstan, the first country in history to have closed the nuclear test site on its territory.
This historical act made by the will of the people of our country 21 years ago has great civilization significance.
In this concern I would like to highlight three main points.
First.
It was Kazakhstan’s decisive step towards its real sovereignty and independence.
Nuclear weapons and radiation was far from being a distant theory for the people of Kazakhstan.
It was a terrible and inexorable evil that had been devastating our land for more than four decades.
A total of nearly 500 nuclear explosions of the so-called peaceful purposes were carried out in the atmosphere, underground and above ground on the test site.
This is half of all the tests carried out in the world during the existence of nuclear weapons.
Day-to-day radiation poisoned steppes, rivers and lakes, slowly destroying all life around.
The Nuclear Devil caused harmful damages to more than one and a half million of people who lived around the test site.
The tragic consequences of nuclear testing are felt to this day.
Broad popular movement to support my initiatives against nuclear tests gave me confidence and energy in promoting the interests of the people.
Despite the tough confrontation of the Soviet leadership and the military-industrial complex, I signed the decree to close the test site.
Second.
The 29th of August has become the starting point in the process of acquiring by the whole Central Asia of the status of a nuclear-free zone region.
Kazakhstan voluntarily renounced the world’s fourth largest nuclear potential, inherited from the Soviet military machine.
It was more than 110 ballistic missiles with 1200 nuclear warheads, able to reach any point on the earth.
At that time, we often heard opinions that lowered the significance of Kazakhstan’s courageous step.
For example, some people argued that this step was explained by our inability and lack of capacity to support atomic arsenal.
I would like to remind that Kazakhstan is the second largest possessor of uranium reserves in the world and ranks first in its production.
The economic potential of the republic is equal or exceeds the GDP of some threshold countries.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, we had both specialists and necessary infrastructure to conduct military nuclear programs.
Therefore, two decades ago the emergence of a new nuclear power in the name of Kazakhstan was only a matter of political will and time.
But we showed political will and unconditionally withdrew from the membership in the Nuclear Club.
In cooperation with the United States and Russia we eliminated the warheads and bombs.
In September 2006, together with other countries we signed the Semipalatinsk Treaty, which declared Central Asia a nuclear-free zone.
Third.
The closure of the Semipalatinsk test site launched a new stage of the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament process.
Before August 29, 1991 mainly restrictive measures on nuclear safety had been taken.
Kazakhstan was the first to accomplish the act of complete and unconditional ban on the testing and on the development of weapons of the judgment day.
Sixteen years ago, by the UN decision the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was opened for signature.
And Kazakhstan was among the first to join it.
Now 183 countries have already joined the Treaty, and 157 states ratified it.
All the member states of the Nuclear Club observe moratorium on nuclear testing.
The closing of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site was followed by other major test sites of the planet – in Nevada, Novaya Zemlya, Lop Nur and Moruroa.
That is why the 29th of August is a decisive moment that has shifted the danger of nuclear apocalypse for the whole world.
I am confident that with years and decades awareness of the significance of this date of the whole international community will only increase.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
The British magazine the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has been measuring the level of the global nuclear threat by the symbolic Doomsday Clock for sixty five years already.
In the beginning of this year the magazine moved the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock one minute closer to the date of possible nuclear disaster.
Why this decision was made?
The scientists wanted to attract urgent attention of the participants of the Global Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul to the array of problems in this field.
Nowadays we observe the reduction of the global nuclear security strengthening process, even despite the regular summits on this subject.
Firstly, we have not reached the universality of the non-proliferation regime.
New nuclear and some threshold countries are still not included in the Treaty.
Secondly, two years ago, the United States and Russia signed the Prague Treaty which furthered a Strategic Arms Reduction process.
However, this did not become an example for other nuclear-weapon states.
Thirdly, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) can’t come into force.
Signatures of only a few threshold group countries are needed for it to become operative.
Fourthly, the issue of the global monitoring of the development of national nuclear power programs remains unregulated.
The lack of clear unambiguous rules casts a shadow of nuclear ambitions or even of support to nuclear terrorism, on almost any nation that seeks to use the peaceful atom.
This manifested injustice does not promote non-proliferation regime, but breeds mistrust in nuclear safety.
There are concerns that the amendments to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material will not come into force, as planned, in 2014.
The reason for these apprehensions is a stupor in their ratification by a number of countries.
Fifthly. The accident at Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant last year clearly outlined for the whole world the problem of technology gap in ensuring safety at the facilities of peaceful atom.
Here is an incomplete list of issues slowing down the formation of the global nuclear safety system.
But all these are only results, not reasons.
The sources of these problems are deeper.
The drawbacks of the modern global politics, largely inherited from the past epochs influence the current state of the global nuclear safety.
This is the inertia of block thinking, the lack of trust and openness in the relations between the countries, the lack of responsibility of individual states.
The chaotic nature of the objective course of a multi-polar world worsens the situation.
Some politicians and military men are still intoxicated with the opium of military atom.
There are forces in the world, which have a restricted vision of the global multi-polar world, first of all, as a combination of a number of centres of nuclear forces.
I am convinced that there is no place for exotica of nuclear umbrellas in the future.
It is immoral to make the issues on nuclear safety a small coin while solving the other problems of inter-state relations.
And at the same time the twenty-first century is impossible without nuclear power.
According to experts, the needs of the world economy in energy will be doubled by 2035.
Today about 2 billion people on the planet have no access to electricity.
For many countries, the solution of problems of poverty, unemployment, lack of food is related to the implementation of projects of peaceful nuclear energy, of course, under the strict control of the UN and the IAEA.
That is why our idea of a nuclear-free world has nothing to do with the radio phobia or utopian desire to ever forget the secret of energy fission.
The nuclear-free world is a complete ban on the military use of nuclear energy.
This is the essence of my proposal on the development and adoption of the Universal Declaration of a nuclear-free world.
I remain a consistent supporter of this idea.
Distinguished participants of the conference!
From the standpoint of political realism it is necessary to recognize that the solution of key problems of the global nuclear security can not be separated from the general process of transformation of the modern world order.
Recently, speaking at the Astana Economic Forum, I called to form a new world order in the format and on the principles of G-GLOBAL.
Acquiring of freedom from the fear of nuclear self-destruction should become an important initiative of the G-GLOBAL forum.
I am confident that the breakthrough in the global nuclear safety is also possible on the basis of five principles proposed by the G-GLOBAL.
First.
A step-by-step plan of comprehensive arms reduction with participation of all nuclear states that should be drawn out and adopted by the UN is necessary.
First of all, the nuclear test ban treaty should be entered into force.
It is important to work out mechanisms of promotion of states that had cancelled their military nuclear programs.
But we have to do it gradually.
For example, we can use the practice of rejecting modernization and deactivate obsolete nuclear warheads and means of delivery.
The work should be obviously done along the process of nuclear disarmament carried out by the nuclear-weapon states - the United States and Russia.
The measures to curtail the nuclear umbrellas are further seen realistic.
It is a question about the restriction of placing and storage of nuclear weapons only outside the national territory of the state, possessing them.
Second.
Strong international security guarantees to all participants of regional nuclear-free zones are very important.
It is necessary to develop mechanisms to encourage states which principally refused from nuclear weapons programs.
The problems associated with the prospects of nuclear power in some countries can be solved only on this basis.
To date, 30 states have taken national commitments in the field of nuclear safety.
The international anti-nuclear law and practical politics should not have double standards and exceptions.
Third.
Nuclear disarmament and nuclear-free world is unthinkable without the trust of all parties involved in this process.
The principle of trust is a reasonable alternative to the military concept of deterrence, including nuclear ones.
In a month we will mark the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan's initiative on the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia.
The CICA today is a developing promising structure for regional and global security.
It brings together 27 states with half of the world's population and produces more than a third of the global output.
The successful development of the CICA shows that in the twenty-first century the issues arising in relations between the states can be constructively resolved only on the basis of trust.
The global nuclear security system should use the potential of the regional structures such as the CICA, the OSCE, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and others.
Therefore, it is necessary to expand their baskets with the issues on formation of a nuclear-free world.
Offering the idea of the G-GLOBAL, I called the global tolerance one of the fundamental principles of the new world order.
Unfortunately, we are still observing false messages to reinforce any religion by the power of nuclear weapons.
Let me remind you that 20 years ago Kazakhstan firmly rejected the advice of some well-wishers and the dubious honor to become the first Muslim nuclear power.
Nuclear weapons are suicidal for humanity.
Suicide as a direct challenge is proscribed by all regions of the world.
And from this point of view aspiration for possession of nuclear weapons power is an absolute blasphemy.
A nuclear-free world is our common goal to which the humanity should aspire.
Only by acting together, we can make our world safer and better.
We have the opportunity to remind the world once again of the tragic consequences of nuclear testing, to encourage the global community to more decisive actions on complete and unalterable prohibition.
For this reason, today Kazakhstan is launching its international project called ATOM.
The name of the project ATOM is an acronym formed of the first four letters in the English language which reads as Abolish Testing. Our Mission.
As part of this project, any person in the world who stands against nuclear weapons can sign the petition to the world’s governments online to call for a complete ban of nuclear tests and thus, to facilitate a sooner adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
I call the participants of the conference and all the people of the world to support ATOM project and make building of a nuclear weapons-free world our most important goal.
Fourth.
I see the global transparency as one of the foundations of the future nuclear-free community of nations.
Kazakhstan through its antinuclear experience has demonstrated to the whole world the power of openness in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
Recently, in transparent manner, we carried out the project of transportation of 210 tons of spent nuclear fuel to a safe storage.
And we continue transparent work on the transferring Kazakh reactors to low-enriched fuel.
With the IAEA a unique automated system of accounting, control and physical protection of natural uranium is being created.
The work on Kazakhstan's bid in the IAEA to place in our country the International Nuclear Fuel Bank has been carried out already at the practical level.
All these are examples of unconditional benefits for our country, which abandoned nuclear weapons.
And it is also an example for other states.
Fifth.
The movement to the nuclear free world is the way to constructive multilateralism.
Positive cooperation for the sake of security of the mankind demonstrates involvement of many countries in the work of transforming the former Semipalatinsk nuclear test site to the territory of peace.
The high level of cooperation on this issue between Kazakhstan, Russia and the United States was marked in the joint statement of Presidents of the three countries, adopted during the Seoul Global Nuclear Security Summit.
Japan, Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and a number of international organizations significantly contributed to the various rehabilitation projects.
We are grateful to all for this help.
Many different programs of the United Nations play an important role in overcoming the effects of nuclear testing.
Two years ago, Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon personally visited the area of the former Semipalatinsk nuclear test site.
I am thankful for his support and high appreciation of the anti-nuclear policy and initiatives of Kazakhstan.
Today, the humanity has a unique chance to get away from the endless brink of nuclear collapse.
And for that, more than ever it is important to bring together all nations and all people of good will!
Parliamentarians from all countries of the world are present at the conference today.
That is why this forum can be called a prototype of the global antinuclear parliamentary assembly.
I suggest considering the establishment of such international public institute.
Moreover, I would like to attract attention of the participants to the G-GLOBAL Internet forum call upon to actively participate in the interactive discussion under the G-GLOBAL format.
Within the framework of this format millions of users have a dialogue on a wide range of issues on formation in the twenty-first century a new, fair world order.
I have no doubt that an important component of this order will be a nuclear-free world.
I call upon you to actively participate in the interactive discussion under the G-GLOBAL format and to work for nuclear-free world for our future and for the future of our grandchildren.

He pointed out that dynamically developing Central Asia plays a strategic role in terms of geopolitics and global energy market, security and stability in a large part of Eurasia.
The vast natural resources in Central Asia cause the keen interest of many states from around the globe.
We must use this deep interest of the largest states in the world as an interest in development, not as a confrontation excuse.
This must serve the interest of the people in our region, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
Ensuring stability and keeping peace in the vast territory of the Asia-Pacific region are a crucial precondition to the achievement of sustainable economic growth.
Today, more than 60 percents of the total population of the world reside in the countries of this region, and their economies make some 28 percents of the global GDP.
However, the Asia-Pacific region is not only an important part of the global economy and not only a territory of great civilizations and world religions.
There is a very high conflict potential in the region of the Asian continent, as nowhere else.
The Conference on Interaction and Confidence building measures in Asia (CICA) is a promising regional organization that was established by the leader of Kazakhstan.
Nursultan Nazarbayev underscored the important role of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in confronting modern challenges and threats.
Currently, Kazakhstan has submitted its application for membership in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and this will foster interregional collaboration and will create favorable conditions to the further development of the Eurasian security zone of ARF – CICA – OSCE.
Kazakhstan’s initiative on developing the dialogue between religions is also aimed at strengthening security.
In 2003 and 2006, two Congresses of world and traditional religions were held in Astana that gathered together representatives of all major world confessions.
That was an important event in maintaining civilizations dialogue.
The Kazakhstani leader reminded that under conditions of globalization there is no such a country in the world that could confront new challenges and modern threats and solve economic problems on its own.
Nursultan Nazarbayev touched issues of further developing interregional collaboration between Central Asia and ASEAN member states and emphasized the necessity of establishing a political economic dialogue ASEAN plus Central Asia.
The President said that in autumn 2006, Central Asian states realizing their responsibility for the future of the region announced Central Asia as a zone free of nuclear weapons.
Meanwhile, Kazakhstan voluntarily disarmed its nuclear arsenal in 1993-1994.

President Nursultan Nazarbayev Delivers a Speech with Address to the People of Kazakhstan Through Crisis to Renovation and Prosperity at the Joint Session of the Parliament
Events
It is emphasized in the Address that the Kazakhstanis have been building their new country over two decades.
The state has taken and is being implemented decisive measures during difficult times of the global crisis, one of the most serious crises for several decades.
The crisis came from outside.
It appeared not within the country but was hidden in the disbalances of global economy.
It was inevitable that the crisis came, the President emphasized.
The situation in the global economy is being worsening.
During one year the oil price decreased about fourfold, price of metals – nearly twofold.
Export proceeds are being significantly decreasing as well.
Our major and neighbor trading partners Russia and Ukraine devalued their national currencies.
Kazakhstan was impelled to devaluate tenge in the interests of domestic producers.
As Nursultan Nazarbayev pointed out, the people of Kazakhstan should know that our country is not only ready to face these challenges but will overcome them and be a strong country and prosperous society after the period of crisis.
For the economy to be viable and flexible we have undertaken structural reforms, started diversification and created a mechanism for saving financial resources – the National Fund.
Kazakhstan has become one of the first countries in the world that swiftly reacted to the crisis and started implementing advance measures.
The Anti-Crisis Plan includes such directions as maintenance of stability of the national financial system, support of housing construction and solving the issues of holders, development of small and medium-sized businesses, agro-industrial complex and realization of innovation projects.
In whole, more than KZT 2.7 trillion has been directed to the country’s economy for the anti-crisis purposes.
Yes, today it is a difficult time. I can not promise you that tomorrow will be easier than today.
And they will come promptly if we act decisively anduse effectively our economic and financial resources.
We will quickly overcome our difficulties if we mobilize our society for the solving of the issues arose, Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed.
It is emphasized in the Address that the Government should meet all its obligations to increase social benefits and pensions as well as wages of the civil servants.
At the same time it is necessary not only to resist the crisis but prepare to the further economic growth.
We need to realize a new plan of further economy modernization for post-crisis development, the head of state stressed.
Within the next two years more than KZT 600 billion will be allocated to the realization of a new plan of economy modernization besides the approved resources received from the National Fund.
That is why revenues from the sector of raw materials that are traditionally entered the National Fund will be directed to the needs of the domestic budget in 2009-2010.
Meanwhile, the amount of reserves will be unchanged.
Another source is a tough economy on all items of expenditures and strict financial discipline.
The violators of financial discipline should be responsible for under the law on crisis.
All administrative, investment and other expenditures should be minimized, the President highlighted.
The head of state set a number of tasks before the Government and the state authorities.
It is necessary to realize the Employment Strategy of the People of Kazakhstan.
For these purpose not less than KZT 140 billion will be allocated from the republican budget.
The local budgets will also co finance the realization of this strategy.
350 thousand of Kazakhstanis will find their jobs.
First of all it is necessary to restore and modernize public utilities system – the objects of water supply and sewerage, heat supply and power engineering.
We need to construct and restore highways, revive social infrastructure such as schools and hospitals, improve and beatify cities and villages.
The regional maslikhats as institutions of local government have to solve themselves where the funds should be directed to.
Meanwhile it is necessary to use the potential of local producers.
It is necessary to extend social workplaces and organize youth practice.
In 2008 more than 13 thousand people realized their opportunities under such programs.
The head of state instructed to allocate one more KZT 8.6 billion for these purposes.
96 thousand people will start working according to these programs.
In order to support unemployment it is planned to increase a term of payment of unemployment benefit from 4 to 6 months allocated from the State Fund of Social Insurance.
Under the new plan of post-crisis development we will continue financing and realization of the investment perspective projects, the President underlined.
Among such important projects are petrochemical complex in Atyrau, the Moinak hydro power station, expansion and reconstruction of the Ekibastuz hydro power station-1, the third power unit of the Ekibastuz hydro power station-2, the Balkhash thermal power plant, the Beineu-Bozoi-Akbulak gas pipeline, and the Western Europe – Western China transit corridor.
The development of the agro-industrious complex has to realize two important for the country tasks – ensuring food security and export diversification.
Export specialization will allow creating more than 500 thousand new workplaces and provide about 8 percent of additional GDP growth in the forthcoming five years.
Prosperity, security and increase of the people’s well-being remain to be a triune task for our state.
I decided to realize this task, and I am responsible before you, my dear compatriots, for implementing it together with you, Nursultan Nazarbayev highlighted.
The President addressed the deputies of Parliament, the members of the Nur Otan party, the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan, all political powers, civil servants, law-enforcement authorities, and mass media to join for overcoming the toughest crisis in the world.
I am convinced that we will overcome all difficulties and make Kazakhstan a strong, prosperous and respected state in the world! the head of state stressed.

The utilization of allocated KZT 120 billion funds under the anti-crisis program throughout the country is as low as 1 percent only.

Over the recent years the quantity of old cars, which are written off in the west countries and imported to us, has considerably increased.
They heavily smoke, pollute the environment and create a threat of traffic security in the streets, the President noted.
The President set a task to the Akimat and the Ministry of Internal Affairs to establish order in the issues of exploitation of old automobiles, to regulate the conduct of proper technical inspection as well as to intensify the crime fighting.

President Nursultan Nazarbayev Attends the Launching Ceremony of the Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Kazakhstan-China Gas Pipeline Together with Presidents of Turkmenistan, China and Uzbekistan in the Turkmen city of Turkmenabat

The pipeline is about 7,000 kilometers long, with 188 kilometers laid in Turkmenistan, 525 kilometers in Uzbekistan, 1,293 kilometers in Kazakhstan and 4,860 kilometers in China.

The fulfillment of the Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Kazakhstan-China Gas Pipeline meets the interests of the four partners, Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed, addressing the participants of the solemn ceremony.
The Central Asian region is geographically far from the most important world markets of natural gas, and that fact hampers construction of gas pipelines or makes it expensive for a certain exporter itself.
In this context, participation of economically powerful players performed by four countries solved the problem of resource-intensive construction.
The fulfillment of this project will enlarge revenues of the partner states not only with gas returns but also with additional Chinese investments in the survey and development of prospective gas fields, which will be necessary for the pipeline growth.
Transit fees also add to budgets of the participating countries.
The functioning of the gas pipeline will require infrastructure modernization in the settlements along the whole route of the pipeline and will also create new jobs and attract delivery of domestic material and equipment.

The President Chairs a Session on the Issue of Constructing Koksaray’s Counter-Regulator
Events
Today in the House of Government, President Nursultan Nazarbayev held a working session on the issue of constructing Koksaray’s water reservoir in the Southern part of the country.
It is known that the construction of this water regulating object has been discussed for many years.
Recently, Kazakhstan’s Government scrupulously considered this problem and supported the idea of its fastest completion.
However, this decision of the Government has had an ambiguous response from the community and governorate of one of the country’s regions. In this regard, the President decided to personally consider this issue and to weight all supporting and opposing views of the project.
Prime Minister Karim Masimov, Deputy Prime Minister Umirzak Shukeev, Minister for emergency situations Vladimir Bozhko, Chairman of the Committee for water resources Anatoly Riabcev, governor of the Southern Kazakhstan region Nurgali Ashimov, director of the Kazhydrovodhoz Institute Leonid Dmitriev and others involved people reported to the President on the conclusions made by the working group studied the problem of constructing Koksaray’s Counter-Regulator on the Syrdaria River.
According their reports, the situation is as follows.
Starting from 1993, Kyrgyzstan has been exploiting Toktagul’s water reservoir in energy mode what means very alternating flow to the Syrdaria River.
In winter time, water volumes are 2.5 times greater and this leads to numerous floods in villages and towns of Southern Kazakhstan. This also was the reason of this year’s flood.
In addition in recent years, Uzbekistan reduced water volumes flowing to Arnasay’s water reservoir, which consequently could not serve as the counter-regulator accumulating excessive water volumes from Kyrgyzstan.
As a result, the Shardarinskoe water reservoir cannot accommodate excessive water volumes of the Syrdaria River.
It was noted at the session that funds allocated on eliminating consequences of the recent flood from republican and local budgets would be equal to 12 billion tenges. The flood destroyed more than 3000 houses and social objects in the Southern Kazakhstan region.
In addition, the Ministry for emergency situations spent other 3.8 billion tenges in order to cope with the emergency situation in the Syrdaria River region.
Hence, the absence of an effective counter-regulator caused additional expenditures of 130 million dollars only this year.
This can be repeated every year threatening 20 villages in the Southern Kazakhstan region and 50 villages in the Kyzylorda region.
The main threat is that large water volumes could destroy the Shardarinskoe water reservoir what would lead to a catastrophe in the region.
Kazakhstan has to have a spare water reservoir that could compensate the absence of flow from Arnasay’s water reservoir in order to ensure the security of the Shardarinskoe water reservoir, to control situation in the Syrdaria River region, to provide water supplement for agricultural enterprises in the Kyzylorda region.
These functions could be implemented by Koksaray’s counter-regulator that could be built near to the village of Koksaray.
According to its Technical Economic Specifications, Koksaray’s Counter-Regulator is not designed to store water for a long period.
Its main purpose is to accumulate excessive water volumes of spring floods for three-four months and then direct them to agricultural consumers and downstream natural ecological systems.
It is also important that the reservoir will accumulate only pure winter waters.
After considering the opposing views, the President summarized the prolonged argue.
This is not an easy decision to spend such significant funds in order to build a new water reservoir.
But we have no choice.
Therefore, we have to build the Koksaray water reservoir.
That is such a social object as, for example, gas pipeline from the Western part of Kazakhstan to its Southern part: these projects are not profitable, but solve a lot of problems, the President said.
In addition, the President instructed to hold explanatory work in the Kyzylorda region on this issue, because some people there mistakenly believe that the construction of the reservoir could pollute the Syrdaria River and to worsen the ecological situation in the Aral region.
Residents of Kyzylorda must take into account the opinion and professional evaluations of specialists and scientists.
In that case, they will understand that this project will be very useful for the region’s population and will improve the ecological situation of Small Aral, the Head of State said.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev sent a telegram of condolences to President of the Republic of Haiti Rene Preval in connection with the earthquake, which has led to numerous destructions and human victims.

The Emblem of the Republic of Kazakhstan
The Emblem is one of the main symbols of the state.
The Russian term gerb for Emblem comes from the German word Erbe (legacy) and means hereditary distinctive sign that represents a combination of figures and objects to which a symbolic sense reflecting cultural and historical traditions of the state is given.
The history is an evidence of the fact that the nomads of the Bronze Age that inhabited the territory of modern Kazakhstan identified themselves with a special symbol which is called totem.
This term has been for the first time used in the Turkic Khaganate.
The Emblem of the sovereign Kazakhstan was officially adopted in 1992.
The authors of the State Emblem are Kazakhstan’s famous architects Zhandarbek Malibekov and Shot-Aman Ualikhanov.
The State Emblem of the Republic of Kazakhstan has the shape of a circle (wheel).
It is a symbol of life and eternity that was especially valued among the nomads of the Great Steppes.
The central heraldic element of the State Emblem is the image of shanyrak (an arched cross-shaped top of the Kazakh yurt) against a sky blue background which irradiates uyks (supports or bearings of the yurt) in the form of sunrays to all sides.
On both right and left of shanyrak there are images of mythical winged quarter horses.
At the top of Emblem there is a volumetric five-pointed star.
There is also the inscription Kazakhstan at the bottom of the Emblem.
The images of shanyrak, uyks, and mythical horses, as well as the inscriptions Kazakhstan, have the colour of gold.
Shanyrak is a main backbone part of the yurt that resembles a blue sky. It is also one of the key elements of Kazakh family dwelling in the traditional culture of Eurasian nomads.
The image of shanyrak on the State Emblem of the republic is a symbol of common home and common homeland of all people living in Kazakhstan.
The stable development of Kazakhstan depends on welfare of each citizen just like the strength and stability of shanyrak depends on reliability of all its uyks.
The winged mythical horses, tulpars, are the key heraldic element of the State Emblem.
The image of the horse stands for such notions as bravery since time immemorial.
The wings symbolize a centuries-old dream of multinational people of Kazakhstan to build a strong and prosperous nation.
They represent pure thoughts and aspiration to successive and constructive development.
The golden wings of racers also resemble golden sheaves of grain that are a sign of labor of the people of Kazakhstan and material welfare of the country.
In centuries past the horns are often used during ceremonial rites of nomads as well as a finial to their fighting banners.
The images of heavenly grace, fertility of the earth and the military fortune in the form of various animals’ horns are always considered as integral parts in symbolic compositions of different peoples.
Therefore, a winged horse with a horn of plenty is an important typological image which has deep semantic and historical roots.
Another element on the coat of arms is a five-pointed star.
This symbol is used by man from ancient times and represents constant aspiration of people to the light of truth and the pursuit of the sublime and eternal matter.
The image of a star on the State Emblem reflects the dream of people to build a state open to all countries of the world for cooperation and partnership.
Hearts and arms of the people of Kazakhstan are open to representatives from all five continents.
The primary colour of the State Emblem is the colour of gold, which serves as a symbol of wealth, justice and magnanimity.
The colour of blue sky symbolizes a serene sky, peace and prosperity.

The state ensures equal access to vital social welfare and its publicly acceptable quality for all members of the society.
In this regard, minimal social state standards were set during the recent reforms.
The state power is responsible for their maintenance, and constantly increases expenditures on social sphere and fights against poverty and unemployment.
Because of this, it was possible to create an effective model of human resources development and to lay foundations for further improvement of living standards, the President emphasized.
At this moment, Kazakhstan has conducted economic reforms and established institutes necessary for sustainable work of market economy.
Kazakhstani business has an opportunity to directly participate in the legislative work of state bodies, in cooperation on concession basis, in the economy’s diversification on the principles of state-private partnership.
In the terms of social responsibility, the state has fulfilled its part and effectively performs its duties.
Today, there is a need to identify and adopt principles of social responsibility.
This is why we are discussing this important matter in such a wide and respectable auditory, Nursultan Nazarbayev underscored.
In the modern world, corporative social responsibility is considered not only as charity, but also as an effective activity improving the business reputation and capitalization of a company.
This is a voluntary contribution of business to the social, economic and ecological development of society.
The President expressed his confidence that Kazakhstan is about to enter such a development stage, when it must to intensively work on the development of this trend including the promotion of principles of the UN global Treaty in the area of social-labor relations in the country.
State power and business must be equal partners in Kazakhstan in solving not only economic, but also social problems, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized.
The main reason of entrepreneurs’ participation in this important work is the formation of a favorable socially non-contentious environment for their activities.
The state expects the policy of social responsibility will create new jobs, competitive social packets for employers, observation of ecological standards.
The President noted that the Kazakhstani business begins to realize its social responsibility.
National companies and large investors serve as an example of that when they allocate funds on projects in education, public health care, sport and culture, offer real support to socially unprotected population strata.
It is necessary to raise the image of the companies that realize their responsibility in the face of the society and to conduct active informational explanatory work, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
The President said he had inked a decree on holding annual competition on social responsibility of business and establishing a special title, Paryz laureate.
The brand of this competition’s winner must be recognizable not only in business circles, but in the entire Kazakhstani society.
Our people must trust entrepreneurs who produce national wealth.
Success comes together with responsibility; this is the formulae that I suggest to take as a guideline to all leaders of Kazakhstani business who begin to realize the direct dependence of their own well-being on the prosperity of all compatriots, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.

Events
The President identified the Summit as the main priority of the Kazakhstan's Chairmanship in the video address to the OSCE Permanent Council in January.
On August 3 of this year, the Ministerial Council of the OSCE participating States made a definitive decision on the holding of the Summit that can be viewed as a sign of the high level of respect on the part of the international community for the successes achieved by the people of Kazakhstan during the years of independence.
We believe that this decision represents great support for the efforts of our country as the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, - said the Head of State.
Kazakhstan is actively promoting the view that the ensuring of European security goes far beyond the continental framework.
Today the international community is already using the notion of Euro Atlantic and Eurasian security.
In assuming the Chairmanship of the OSCE, Kazakhstan declared its intention to strengthen the role of the Organization in countering new threats and challenges, primarily terrorism and drug trafficking.
The main priorities of the Kazakhstan's Chairmanship include the stepping up of efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the situation in Afghanistan, taking effective measures towards the events in Kyrgyzstan, strengthening the role of the OSCE in the development of economic co-operation and the resolution of environmental problems, especially the problem of the Aral Sea.
Members of the OSCE now have to devise joint steps to deal with new and existing threats in all three dimensions in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian area.
The Astana Summit should identify the strategic areas of work and road map for the OSCE's development.
The meeting on the highest level will make it possible to adapt the Organization to the present-day realities. It will demonstrate to the international community the successful evolution of the OSCE from Helsinki to Astana.
The Head of state noticed that the fact of holding one of the major political events in international life in Astana will not only increase the authority of our country in the world but also impart a fresh impetus to the socio-economic and democratic development of Kazakhstan and further strengthen the unity and patriotism of the people of Kazakhstan.
The holding of the OSCE Summit - the first international forum of this scale in the entire post-Soviet area - is not only a great honour but also a major responsibility.
It is now important to ensure its preparation and conduct at a highly organized level.
We have a unique chance to demonstrate the main values of our society - tolerance, respect for traditions, trust and mutual understanding, - said Nursultan Nazarbayev.

Events
Issues of fight against corruption remain to be one of top priorities in the work of President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
His harsh and fair estimations of the work of law enforcement bodies given at the recent extended session of the Prosecutor General Office are the confirmation of his special concern and dissatisfaction with the situation in this area.
In his annual address to the people of Kazakhstan, the country’s leader again required a cardinal and crucial improvement in the work of law enforcement bodies and real and significant successes in fight against corruption, the Secretary of State said opening the session.
Today, we are going to talk not about cosmetic measures or abstract and barely controllable programs, but about concrete actions on eliminating this evil.
As the President said, it is necessary to fight against corruption regardless of personalities, titles, merits and affiliations and law enforcement bodies must start this work on eliminating the evil in their organizations.
In the Secretary of State’s opinion, it is principally important to ensure the inevitability of penalty for each fact of corruption.
Only by doing that we will be able to assure our people in the state’s ability to protect the rights and interests of its citizens and to practically implement the principle of legal equality of all people.
In addition, the mass media and community must participate in the fight against corruption.
This is why the President and the leader of the Nur Otan Party set concrete tasks in this area for the party, which must be on the cutting edge of powerful anticorruption public movement.
Now, it is necessary to ensure close coordination between law enforcement bodies and community, to develop effective mechanisms of strategic and operative cooperation.
In other words, fight against corruption must involve every citizen in our country.
The further successful development of our country and its accession to the group of the most competitive countries depend on the effective implementation of tasks set by the President.
There is no need to underscore the special responsibility of the Commission for issues of fight against corruption in resolving these important problems, the Secretary of State emphasized.
The Commission’s members considered submitted reports on the implementation of the state program for fight against corruption for 2006-2010 and cardinal measures on the execution of instructions given by the President.

to react in an operative and effective manner to reports on facts of corruption known from the mass media and via trust telephones; to publish results of control;
to conduct such personnel policy that excludes any possibility of appointing a person, which does not have appropriate individual and professional qualities, to leading positions;
to complete the introduction of electronic system for automatic distribution of files between judges and digital recording of judicial process;

Head of State Nursultan Nazarbaev Delivered a Speech at the Joint Sitting of the Parliament’s Chambers and Introduced a Bill of the Law On Making Amendments and Additions to the Constitution of the Country.
Events
Serious constitutional amendments that must radically change the political system of the state were submitted for the Parliament’s consideration.
I suggest following the way of such amendments to the Constitution, when the republic remains presidential, but with significantly broadened authorities of Parliament.
This will transform the model of our republic from presidential to presidential parliamentary one, - Nursultan Nazarbaev stated.
It is the issue of strengthening the Parliament’s role, increasing the number of deputies, new procedures of forming the Government on the principles of parliamentary majority, introduction of proportional election system of deputies to the lower chamber of Majilis, cancellation of the party affiliation of the Senate deputies and many other political innovations.
The Head of State suggested increasing the number of Majilis deputies up to 107 deputies. 98 deputies will be elected according to the proportional system, and 9 deputies will represent the Assembly of the people of Kazakhstan.
It is also suggested to increase the number of deputies in the Senate by increasing the presidential quota that will be changed from 7 up to 15 deputies.
Some of them will be appointed after consultations with the Assembly of the people of Kazakhstan.
It is necessary to do that in order to take into account the interests of large ethnic groups and will serve to the further consolidation of the society.
Hence, the number of the Parliament’s deputies will increase by 38 persons and will be equal to 154 deputies.
This is a normal proportion for 15 millions of our people, - Nursultan Nazarbaev noted.
According to suggested by the bill new procedures of forming the Government, Prime Minister has to be appointed by President after consultations with factions of political parties and by the appropriation of a majority of the Parliament’s deputies.
I would like to emphasize that the key moment is in the establishment of new procedures of the forming and functioning of the Government on the basis of parliamentary majority.
Now the Parliament plays the main role in appointing Prime Minister and consequently the Government.
The implementation of such an approach will first of all raise the role of political parties in forming the Government.
Secondly, it will lead to that that the party having a parliamentary majority will be responsible for the formation and consequent actions of the Government, which will implement the program of the winning party or coalition, - the President underscored.
Concerning the choice of the election system the Head of State said that the suggested transfer to elections of Majilis deputies under proportional elective system would ensure representation and take into account the specific features of the country.
The new form of conducting elections in Kazakhstan will offer political parties additional opportunities for strengthening their role in the political system of the country, and will reflect the real status of political forces and the population’s will, - Nursultan Nazarbaev said.
The President offered to refuse the constitutional prohibition of state financing of social associations and to develop practical mechanisms for partial support of the activities of political parties from the republican budget.
Also the President thinks that a retraction of the presidential term from 7 down to 5 years would be appropriate, and also it was suggested that regions’ governors must be elected with the appropriation of corresponding maslikhats (regional elective entity).
Judicial confirmation of an arrest is going to be introduced in the area of judicial law reform.
Also the actual abolition of the death penalty has been announced in Kazakhstan.
Having established in the Constitution that the death penalty can be applied to those who committed terrorist acts caused casualties or especially violent crimes during a war, Kazakhstan by doing that has become a country that virtually do not practice capital punishment, - Nursultan Nazarbaev underscored.
The President said while presenting the new packet of initiatives on altering the current Constitution that was adopted in 1995:
I am sure that it is time to make the amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan and enter a new stage in the development of our country.
I hope that the Parliament will intensively work on the legislative support of the new stage of democratization in Kazakhstan.

Director of the OSCE Secretariat Conflict Prevention Center Herbert Salber has been sent to Bishkek.
Nursultan Nazarbayev condemned the violence and looting which took place in the neighboring republic.
The Kyrgyz Republic is our neighboring country.
I view this situation with great regret.
It's a pity that our brotherly nation is permanently falling in such abyss.
At the same time, the politicians try to assure us that they are caring of their people.
Actually, the marauding and looting continue within these two days.
The stores are burnt, the banks are closed, and business shuts down.
When there is instability in the country, there will be nothing.
Instead of dealing with politics the authorities must provide the people with jobs and food, first of all.
To date, over the half of Kyrgyz population lives in poverty.
Unemployment rate is very high.
The GDP in Kyrgyzstan is USD 800 per capita, while in Kazakhstan this figure makes USD 8,000.
All these years Kazakhstanis live in peace, work and bring up their children.
Stability is the key factor of Kazakhstan's today's life.
Despite multi-ethnic structure of population our people respect each other and are tolerant towards each other.
This gives us an opportunity to develop and attract investments.
All of these demonstrate that stability and peaceful life of people are the major factors of the country's prosperity, Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed.

Dear compatriots!
It is a great pleasure for me and for my spouse to be together with you today and congratulate you on this blessed holyday.
All Kazakhstanies together with Orthodox Christians are meeting this holyday on this spring bright Sunday, because Christ Easter is considered as a great example of loving all neighbors regardless of their believes, nationalities and other differences.
Believers devote this day to charity, help and support for neighbors, because good, mercy and compassion initially were laid in the basis of the holyday.
I am sincerely glad, that believers of different religions live in peace and accord in our multinational and multi confessional Kazakhstan, and we are celebrating many religious holydays.
As you know, according to my suggestion I made at the Jubilee Session of the Assembly of the people of Kazakhstan, since this year Kurban Ayt and Christmas have been announced to be rest-days.
The great wisdom of the people of our country is contained in the aspiration for unity and tolerance.
This cannot be met anywhere else in the world, especially now, when the civilization conflicts have been deepen so hard.
Our land, historically situated on the crossroad of the world religions, is a worthy example of how to maintain peace and dialog between different religions in a poly-confessional country.
That is a result of laborious and constant efforts of our people and of the state policy oriented to strengthening inter confessional and international accord. – The President said while congratulating Orthodox Christians.

Nothing happens without a man’s initiative.
The success of Kazakhstan is based on the personality of Nursultan Nazarbayev.
I see the achievements of the country, the infrastructural projects carried out, the rising level of people’s lives.
Nursultan Nazarbayev is the state leader on the global level.

Events
Prime Minister Karim Massimov, Head of the Presidential Administration Aslan Mussin, members of the Government, and heads of state bodies took part in the meeting.
In his opening address, the Head of state announced preliminary results of the work in 2011.
The outgoing year has been important, significant and successful.
Kazakhstan is completing the year of the twentieth anniversary of its independence with good indicators.
GDP real growth at year-end has reached 7.3%, and GDP per capita has reached US $11,000.
Aggregate international reserves totaled US $75 million.
The year has been successful for the agrarian sector, with production output growth reaching 25.5% from a year earlier; there is growth in every sector: almost 3% growth in construction, around 4% in manufacturing, as well as trade, and transport.
The President said the Industrialisation Map at present includes a total of 609 projects worth 9.6 trillion tenge.
A total of 90,000 jobs have been created over the past two years.
Production of 106 items that have never been produced in Kazakhstan before have been mastered.
Under the instruction of the Head of State the implementation of the Programme of Residential Construction has been launched.
The problems of 53,000 real estate mortgage holders at 389 sites have been resolved.
This was the decision by the government that has had an immense impact.
Since 2010 with the implementation of the Business Road Map 2020 Programme, 750 projects worth 240 billion tenge have been endorsed.
This also means the creation of new jobs, and buoyancy for the economy.
Nursultan Nazarbayev underscored the positive results have been also achieved in the social sphere.
The unemployment level has fallen to 5.3%.
The Salamatty Kazakhstan Healthcare Development State Programme for 2011-2025 has been launched setting absolutely specific indicators on reduction of maternal and child mortality, morbidity rate.
The President noted the anniversary year has been the year of further accelerated economic growth and improvement of living standards.
Kazakhstan citizens can celebrate the new 2012 year with satisfaction and with a sense of fulfilled duty.
At the same time we have to acknowledge that there are some unresolved issues.
The events in the Mangistau region have become a serious trial for the entire Kazakhstan.
A challenge has been thrown down at us in the anniversary year.
The goal was to bring division in our society – social, interethnic, inter-religious and so on.
The investigation is right now in process on uncovering not only the reasons but also organisers of the events.
We know provisionally that organized criminal groups who divided the money and had to cover up their tails were behind the events, and this is why arson fires were lit.
We will get down to all this.
We know about the tails coming from abroad, we know what subversion activities were carried out inside the country.
The Prosecutor’s Office together with corresponding bodies must carry out a thorough investigation into all these facts.
The main reason is that government officials, the Samruk-Kazyna management and all who were directly responsible for dealing with labour disputes showed irresponsibility, and, in fact, misinformed.
This is why all of us should draw a lesson from these events.
I want once again to draw the attention of the Prosecutor General to the need to ensure transparent, fair consideration of criminal cases and bring all organisers and instigators of these riots to responsibility with the utmost rigour of the law.
I also commission the Presidential Administration and the Secretary of State to carry out explanatory works on these events, the President said.
The Head of state noted that akims (mayors) should rapidly solve the problems of social importance on the ground.
The holidays are approaching, but local officials should not sit back and relax, they must work.
There are no little things in the work.
During this period, akims of all levels will ensure the houses with electricity, water and gas supply, and solve other issues of social significance.
Winter is cold this year.
Under these circumstances all the community services in all regions, towns and villages should be ensured without failure.
Throughout the heating season, the issue should be taken under special control by akims.
They should ensure trouble-free operation of trade and transport.
Each akim must turn his attention to citizens’ complaints, to quickly solve all the issues of their appeals.
The local media should be provided with more information about the problems and the work done to address them.
The President said the next year people are expecting a new wave of global financial and economic crisis.
Kazakhstan has been preparing for this since long ago.
But if the crisis starts, it should not catch anyone off balance - both in the administrative circles and in the field.
The government needs to significantly strengthen efforts to monitor the development trends in the world economy.
The same goes for the Presidential Administration and other state bodies.
It is essential to work through various scenarios of crisis and ways to overcome it.
While in a crisis, we should be particularly thrifty, above all, it refers to the expenses of government agencies and national companies.
They should give up on expensive, noisy events, presentations and international conferences.
The time has come to stop all this, Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed.
The President noted that starting from January Kazakhstan will be operating in the Single Economic Space with Russia and Belarus.
It opens up new opportunities and new outlet markets for Kazakh businesses.
At the same time, domestic enterprises enter new competitive field with our partners.
Kazakh producers should be prepared for this competition, and must come out of it strong and resolute, to prepare for competition on a scale of the World Trade Organization.
The government should clearly explain the rules of the SES, including all the benefits and risks.
There should be no reticence.
Those who criticize do not understand the essence of the issues and the benefit for the country.
In particular, this work should be focused on small and medium-sized businesses.
The government, the Presidential Administration, the ministries and agencies need to work on this.
The President stressed that the industrialization programme will remain in the spotlight as it is now.
Each state agency, including the government and local executive bodies, will prepare a report twice a year.
And these tasks are to be the priority goals.
The Head of state noted that during this period every minister is personally responsible for the condition and operation of the industry he/she is in charge of.
The Minister of Transport and Communications will be responsible for flights and trains delays.
Mayors will be held accountable for accidents of heating systems.
The President tasked the Prime Minister to take all the work of each ministry and agency under his personal control.
Nursultan Nazarbayev has banned all New Year and other state holiday trips abroad for all senior officials of the Government, ministries and departments as well as all akimats (local executive authorities).
Those holidays should be celebrated inside the country with our people.
This concerns not only the upcoming New Year holiday, but also all national and public holidays, the President emphasized.
The President noted that during the election period akims together with the officials of the Central Election Commission need to create all the necessary conditions for holding open, fair and transparent elections.
They should provide an impeccable work of election commissions.
Kazakhstan citizens must understand the significance of the parliamentary election and the importance of their participation in it.
It is important to encourage the Kazakhstan people to come to polling stations and fulfill their civic duty.
The peace and further implementation of all our programmes to benefit people would depend on what kind of a Parliament we choose.
Under the conditions of possible impending crisis and instability, we need to further protect and strengthen the unity of our people.
This theme requires constant attention and active work, the President said.
The President noted that during the election period there are always those willing to play ethnic and religious cards.
Such attempts must be given a decisive rebuff.
It is necessary to explain that it contradicts our principles, stability, development of the state and our independence.
Kazakhstan People’s Assembly must actively work across the country.
Elections should be a factor of society consolidation around our core values - stability, unity and solidarity.
Only by these means we would continue our way forward.
I talked about this in detail in my speech on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of our independence.
We should mobilized ourselves to become closer to the people, their needs, and work in such a way so that the pulse of the country, the everyday work is not interrupted, so that our people celebrate holidays in a good way, and we well pass through the election period, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
Following the meeting the Head of state gave a number of specific instructions.

The Cooperative Threat Reduction programs are critical tools used to fight one of the gravest threats facing the world, the danger that terrorists and proliferators could gun access to weapons or materials of mass destruction.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, the people of Kazakhstan gave up their nuclear weapons, which enhanced their security and made Kazakhstan a global leader in nonproliferation.
With the help from the CTR programs, Kazakhstan has worked to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction legacy inherited from the Soviet Union and set a positive example for countries around the world.
On this anniversary, we celebrate the strong ties between the people of the United States and Kazakhstan, and we renew commitments that will strengthen the next era of nonproliferation partnership between our countries.
I appreciate President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan's government, and the citizens of Kazakhstan for their commitment to peace and dedication to disarmament.
Your efforts have helped achieve unprecedented success countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
In turn, the US Senate honor the courage and foresight that led President Nursultan Nazarbayev to conclude that the future of his country was best secured through the renunciation and elimination of more than 1,400 nuclear weapons located in Kazakhstan.
On this day in 1993, Kazakhstan also joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-weapons state, enshrining these aspirations in international law.
The USD Senators consider this critical judgment paved the way for 15 years of close cooperation between the United States and the Republic of Kazakhstan to safely and securely eliminate nuclear and biological weapons, materials and infrastructure left behind in Kazakhstan after the break-up of the Soviet Union.
This solid base of cooperation has led to along list of shared successes: the closure of the Soviet Union's test site, the removal of nuclear weapons, the elimination of a biological weapons factory, and the securing of dangerous nuclear and biological materials.
The telegram reads, in particular: Under President Nazarbayev's leadership, Kazakhstan is one of the world's leaders in nuclear nonproliferation - not merely in words, but - most importantly - by actions and deeds.
We believe that the Nunn-Lugar agenda - the cornerstone of US-Kazakhstan cooperation - provides a platform for global cooperation to reduce weapons and materials, and we applaud Kazakhstan's leadership in advancing this vision of a safer world.

We had a very constructive meeting with the President of Kazakhstan.

President Nursultan Nazarbayev Arrives in Pavlodar Region on Working Trip
Events
The Pavlodar region is one of the major industrial regions in Kazakhstan.
There are large enterprises of non-ferrous metallurgy, machinery, energy, extracting and food industries in the region, namely Kazakhstan Aluminum JSC, TNK Kazchrom open JSC, Aksu Plant of Ferroalloys, Ekibastuz coal field and others.
Today, other two innovative enterprises, the Kazakhstani electrolysis plant and plant for producing seamless steel pipes of KSP Steel Ltd joined the region’s industrial complex.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev attended the solemn opening ceremony of the enterprises.
Addressing the workers of the first Kazakhstani electrolysis plant, the President underscored that metallurgical industry is an important sector of the economy and significant funds were allocated on its development.
In the Soviet period, Kazakhstan possessing vast alumina reserves of high quality did not have a possibility to produce its own aluminum.
The alumina was exported abroad supplying the metallurgical industry of other countries.
The President emphasized that the first Kazakhstani electrolysis plant was built in independent Kazakhstan.
By doing that, Kazakhstan is turning into a state, which can export competitive production to the world markets.
The construction of the plant was initiated in May 2005. The President participated in the ceremony of laying the cornerstone of the plant.
Today, 27 months later, the plant’s first train has been completed.
The designed capacity of the electrolysis plant, which is equal to 250 tons of aluminum a year, will be reached by 2010.
More than 850 million dollars were invested in the construction and will be paid off in the nearest future.
The plant will be the major part of the vertically integrated aluminum cluster that is being established in the Pavlodar region, and its completion will have a powerful multiplicative effect that will transform the structure of the region’s economy and develop small- and medium size business.
I was dreaming of such a plant.
This dream has come to reality, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
The President put an emphasis on the special role of the ENRC in this project, which invest heavily in the development of metallurgy in our country.
The President conferred state awards upon a group of specialists of the plant.
The Otan Order was conferred upon president of the Kazakhstani electrolysis plant Almaz Ibragimov.
After that, the Head of State attended the opening ceremony of the plant for producing seamless steel pipes.
This is the first enterprise of this kind not only in Kazakhstan, but in Central Asia also.
The completion of this plant was possible because of the active policy for economy diversification and industrial innovative development.
In recent years, a number of industrial high-technological enterprises were built in Balkash, Karaganda and Aktubinsk.
There never has been such a plant not only in Kazakhstan, but in our entire region, Nursultan Nazarbayev underscored.
The plant’s construction claimed 800 million euros, and its equipment was imported from 20 countries from over the globe.
The manufacturing process is completely automatic.
The designed capacity of the new enterprise is equal to 270 thousand tons of steel pipes, which are required in Kazakhstan’s oil and gas industries, energy sector and civil infrastructure.
Oil extraction has been doubled over the last ten years in Kazakhstan.
This requires new transportation routes to the world markets.
The development of the oil and gas industries will have a positive effect on the development of Kazakhstan’s non-extracting industries for a long time.
The President drew attention to the social effect of introducing these new factories.
I would like to underscore seven thousand jobs have been created at these two plants.
This is the most important accomplishment that people need, the Head of State said.
The President conferred state awards upon workers of the new factory on the occasion of Independence Day.
This afternoon, the President met with activists of the Pavlodar regional branch of the Nur Otan People’s Democratic Party.

Today at the Akorda Residence President Nursultan Nazarbayev Receives Chairman of the Supreme Court Bektas Beknazarov
Events
The Chairman of the Supreme Court informed the President on the work being held to modernize the judicial system due to the President’ Address.
According to Nursultan Nazarbayev, judges face big tasks and bear great responsibility.
The new law is expected to increase the people’s confidence in the judicial protection of people and provide fair court decisions.
We can not talk about the rule of law, until we achieve this.
The law includes everything.
All issues should be resolved in local courts and red tape should be excluded.
Juvenile courts have opened and we have made changes to their activities.
The Supreme Court should be effectively using its oversight role, the correct resolution of the issues and provide supervision to prevent violations of the law, the President stated.
Bektas Beknazarov added that the new law is directed to the individuals who apply to court for the protection of their rights.
Repeated appeals to courts are excluded.
The new law expands the powers of the Court of Appeal.
The Chairman of the Supreme Court stressed that the amendments to the law are aimed at diminution or facilitation of the Supreme Court’s activities.
Under the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Supreme Court is the higher echelon of the judicial system that considers civil, criminal and other cases in supervisory order and comes before local courts.
Bektas Beknazarov also noted that appeals of citizens will be considered in the courts of first instance.
To date, the number of prisoners serving sentences in prisons is decreasing.
For example, last year, the number of prisoners has decreased by half, compared to the situation two or three years ago.
Now, only those, who have committed serious and heinous crimes, are sentenced to imprisonment.
However, the number of such crimes gradually decreases.
As for economic crimes, according to your instructions, we plan to expand the use of alternative sanctions involving no deprivation of liberty, but in the form of adequate property compensation for damage caused by the crime, the Chairman of the Supreme Court added.
Bektas Beklnazarov also stressed that the amendment to the Law On Introduction of Amendments and Supplements to the Constitutional Law On Judicial System and The Status of Judges in the Republic of Kazakhstan clearly defined terms of orders of appeals for court decisions.
In addition, the role of the Supreme Judicial Council significantly increased in the formation of the judiciary.
The mechanism of the selection of candidates for judges now stipulates an exam, training and an open competition.
The number of judges of the Supreme Courts is also decreased.
To date, there are 30 judges instead of previous 45.
The Chairman of the Supreme Court also briefed the President on the progress of the project called Juvenile Justice in Kazakhstan, which has shown its effectiveness and necessity.
Since 2007, the specialized juvenile courts have been established only in the cities of Astana and Almaty.
And this year, 16 juvenile courts are to be open and will be in operation in all regional centres.
The issues on skilled personnel policy in juvenile authorities and the provision of their logistics and maintenance are also being developed.
The main goal of the establishment of juvenile courts is to avoid further criminalization of an adolescent and promote their social rehabilitation.
On the outcome of the meeting with the Chairman of the Supreme Court, the President gave some instructions to improve the efficiency of the judicial system in Kazakhstan.

Congressman Edolphus Towns (D-NY 10th) delivered a speech in the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress.
I welcome the unanimous decision of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to elect Kazakhstan its Chair-in-Office for 2010, reached on November 30, 2007 in Madrid. This is undoubtedly a monumental event not only in the history of modern Kazakhstan, but also the OSCE of which the United States is a member.
For the first time, a country which in recent past was part of the Soviet Empire will lead this international institution.
This vividly shows that Kazakhstan has managed to make a breakthrough from its communist past to a democratic future in a short time.
This is also testimony to the evolutionary development of the OSCE itself.
This is a stellar moment for the people of Kazakhstan, and a recognition of the longstanding efforts of their leader, President Nursultan Nazarbayev, on building a truly democratic and free society.
President Nazarbayev has managed to achieve things leaders of many other countries can only dream of.
To pull the country from the chaos of Soviet era and lead it towards the ranks of economically strong and democratically developed nations of the world in a little more than a decade takes incredible efforts, strategic vision and endless care for one’s people.
Today, Kazakhstan is a recognized leader in Central Asia, and I believe that, as Chair-in-Office, Kazakhstan will not only strengthen its leadership in that key region but will also help strengthen the OSCE’s authority internationally, as well as improve mutual understanding and cooperation between East and West he said.
Congresswoman Shelley Berkley (D-NV 1st) writes in her congratulation letter that she is pleased to see a strong U.S. ally such as Kazakhstan ascend to such an important post, and I look forward to Kazakhstan’s leadership role.
On my visit to Kazakhstan this past July, I was very impressed by the efforts of your government to foster tolerance and diversity, which are the underpinnings of effective democracy.
Kazakhstan is moving toward greater openness and democracy and is developing an ever-stronger alliance with the United States.
I am pleased at the OSCE’s decision to recognize Kazakhstan’s development and I look forward to working with your government and the OSCE in deepening our friendship and cooperation in the future’ hr letter says.

The Davos Forum is a venue for numerous meetings as it gathers together a great number of heads of states and governments, heads of international organisations and leading companies.
Since Kazakhstan gained independence, I used to visit this forum many times because our country was not so famous at that moment.
The goal of those visits was to tell and attract attentions of investors to a young republic.
I would like to remind that exactly at that time formation of the Foreign Investors’ Council was initiated.
Today, with regard to adoption of the Strategy-2050 and its goal to enter top 30 world’s developed countries there is a need to tell participants of the forum about this strategy, the President of Kazakhstan said.

The elections to the European Parliament scheduled for the middle of the year will be very serious.
The economies of European countries and the USA are gradually rising, which is good news.
At the same time, China’s economic growth rate lowering is being observed, which is, in turn, poses an alarming signal.
The state of economy in Russia is important as well.
All of these issues trouble us, as we are part of the world community and all the changes we are facing worldwide affect us.
Our task is to take them into account and take appropriate measures in order to go out of such possible difficult situations, Nursultan Nazarbayev concluded.

All of these countries should be congratulated for being awarded this important duty.
The selection of Kazakhstan as chair for 2010 is especially significant for several important reasons.
Kazakhstan will be the first ex-Soviet republic to assume the chairmanship of the OSCE, which is quite timely given that many of the countries in region are continuing to struggle with the transition from communism to full democracy.
Kazakhstan, as the largest country in the region, may be in the best position to promote the OSCE’s principal mandates of respect for human rights and advancing democracy.
Kazakhstan fully cooperated with OSCE’s monitoring and reporting during its August 18 parliamentary election. It allowed 1200 election observers to cover 1743 polling stations.
Prior to its elections, Kazakhstan adopted reforms to increase the transparency and integrity of its elections and ensure public access to election information and the media.
The Kazakh way … includes improving freedoms for the press and human rights groups, greater confidence in the rule of law, and a strengthening of democratic values.
It is my sincere hope that the other CIS countries will take the latter path.
In his message to the Head of State, Darrell Issa wrote: As the first ex-Soviet republic to assume the chairmanship of the OSCE, Kazakhstan will have an extraordinary opportunity to set a good example for other nations within the Commonwealth-of-Independent States that are transitioning to democracy.
Your nation’s actions in the chair will be closely watched throughout the region and the world, and I am confident that it will uphold its duties and responsibilities.
Under your stewardship, Mr.President, Kazakhstan has shunned authoritarian rule, and is moving further down the democratic path.
It is my sincere hope that you will continue to increase the checks and balances within your government, and further strengthen the role of parliament, so that it may better serve the Kazakhs people.
Obtaining the chair of the OSCE is an accomplishment that your republic should be proud of.
In his message, Tom Lantos, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the U.S. House of Representatives noted: As the largest country in Central Asia, Kazakhstan has an opportunity to lead by example in promoting the OSCE’s principal mandates of furthering respect for human rights and advancing democracy, particularly in an area where countries are struggling to make the transition from communism to democracy.

President Nursultan Nazarbayev Signs the Law On Dismissal of the Majilis of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan of the Third Convocation and Conduction of Special Elections of Deputies of the Majilis of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Events
The President announced this during a meeting with members of the Majilis faction of the Nur Otan People Democratic Party in the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
As the decree says, additional elections of the Majilis deputies according to party lists are going to be held on 18 August, 2007, and elections of the Majilis deputies nominated by the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan will be held on 20 August.
According to Paragraph 63 of the renewed Constitution of Kazakhstan, the President’s consultations with the Chairmen of the Parliament Houses and with the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, which were held this morning, preceded the adoption of this historically important decision.
Kazakhstan’s leader reminded that responding to a request of Majilis deputies the Constitutional Council of the country had decided that new constitutional authorities of the Parliament would be in law only if new elections would be conducted.
Due to that, 61 Majilis deputies have sent their address to the President and have requested to dismiss the Majilis deputies of the third convocation and to appoint the date of new elections.
The Parliament Speakers and the Prime Minister have supported the request of the Majilis deputies during the consultations.
On the same day, the President met with members of the Majilis faction of the Nur Otan People Democratic Party in the Parliament.
In their speeches Majilis deputies Nurbakh Rustemov, Valeriy Kotovich, Erlan Nigmatullin and Alexander Milutin said that additional elections were required as the only legitimate mean to practically implement the constitutional reform immediately, without a delay until 2009.
While delivering speech before the party faction, the President agreed that this situation was a barrier to the process of political modernization.
I was not tending to dismiss the Majilis before the end of its term.
There were precedents of Parliament dismissals caused by conflicts between power branched in the history of our country.
There is no such a conflict situation today, the President underscored.
In the President’s opinion, Majilis deputies were very competitive and coped effectively enough with the task of legislative support to the reforms and successfully interacted with the Government, and also had a good reputation in the population.
However, there is a political and legal collision between new constitutional reality and current Majilis authorities.
Taking into account, that the request expresses the collective will of people deputies supported by the Nur Otan Party, I have to make a decision that completely meets the interests of the dynamic development of our country.
If this is your final decision, I accept it and dismiss the Majilis of the Parliament and appoint the date of new elections, Nursultan Nazarbayev concluded.

I mean the general political situation in the country, and those important changes that the Nur Otan Party has experienced.
Our party has strengthened its ranks by uniting with three allied political parties and today it is a nationwide force.
Indeed, it is a truly people’s party, which is an independent buttress to the country’s political system because of its political influence and scale of actions, and is a stabilizing factor of political process in Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev noted in his speech.

The President called all political parties to demonstrate political culture, maturity and to pursue only the interests of our people, not their own ambitions.
Anyway, all parties need to unite their efforts in order to assist our country to reach a new development level in the new century.
All kazakhstani people want this.

Each kazakhstani must benefit from the economy growth!
The party’s all activities must be targeted solely at implementing the interests of our multinational people!
All members of our party must remember that our main political resource is the trust of population.
And all our efforts have to be targeted at the support of this trust, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized.

The Flag of the Republic of Kazakhstan
The Flag is one of the main symbols of the state that represents its sovereignty and identity.
The Russian term flag for Flag comes from the Dutch word Vlag and means cloth of officially adopted size and colour and commonly with an image of emblem (coat of arms).
It was designed by Shaken Niyazbekov.
The State Flag of the Republic of Kazakhstan is a rectangular breadth of blue colour with the image of the sun in its center with a soaring steppe eagle underneath.
Along the flagstaff there is a vertical band with the national ornamental patterns.
The images of the sun, rays, eagle and ornament are of golden colour.
The ratio of the Flag’s width to its length: 1:2.
In heraldry each colour has its own specific meaning.
Thus, a blue-sky colour symbolizes honesty, fidelity and integrity.
Moreover, the blue-sky colour has a deep symbolic meaning in Turkic culture.
The ancient Turkic peoples always worship the Sky as their God, and their blue-sky banner symbolized devotion to Father Ancestor.
The blue colour of the State Flag of Kazakhstan means pure sky, peace and prosperity, and self-colour of the background represents the unity of our country.
According to the heraldic principles the sun symbolizes wealth and abundance, life and energy.
That is why the sun rays on the flag have the form of grain, a symbol of wealth and welfare.
By representing the sun at its state attributes Kazakhstan reaffirms its commitment to universal values, which also indicates that the new young country is full of life-affirming energy and is open to all countries for cooperation.
The image of the steppe eagle is one of the main heraldic attributes which is used on coat of arms and flags of various peoples for centuries.
This image is commonly considered as a symbol of power, insight and generosity.
A soaring steppe eagle represents by itself a power of the state, its sovereignty and independence, aspiration to high goals and sustainable future.
The image of the steppe eagle on the world outlook of Eurasian nomads has a special place and is associated with such notions as freedom and fidelity, sense of dignity and courage, strength and purity of thoughts.
The symbolically rendered silhouette of the golden steppe eagle reflects aspiration of the young sovereign state to the heights of world civilization.
Another important element of the State Flag is a vertical band with the national ornamental patterns.
This Kazakh ornament is one of the forms of specific artistic perception of world in strict accordance with aesthetic styles of the people.
Representing a harmony of various forms and lines, it is also an expressive means of discovery of the inner world of the people.
The national ornament along the flagstaff represents the art and cultural traditions of the people of Kazakhstan.

Central Asia is a very important region for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Kazakhstan is a very important country in this region.
Moreover, your country has an ambition of chairing OSCE in the near future, so it was very important to discuss eyeball to eyeball what the OSCE could mean for Kazakhstan and also what Kazakhstan could mean for OSCE.

Address of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan N.Nazarbayev to the nation.
January 17, 2014
Addresses of the President of Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan’s way – 2050:
common aim, common interests, common future
Dear fellow citizens!
Distinguished Members of Parliament!
A year ago I announced the new political course for Kazakhstan until 2050.
The main goal is to join the group of 30 most developed countries.
This project is called Eternal Kazakhstan. It is a mature vision of a new era in the history of our country.
Over the last 22 years Kazakhstan has accomplished a great deal.
We have created our own successful model of development.
Every citizen is immensely proud of their country.
They have faith in tomorrow and believe in the future of Kazakhstan.
97 percent of our citizens recognize the stability of their social-economic condition and its continuous improvement year to year.
Today the achievements of our country are the national pride of every citizen.
Strong and powerful countries are formed on long-term vision and stable economic development.
Strategy Kazakhstan - 2050 is a modernization path for all areas to provide sustainable growth.
It is a big challenge, which will test and strengthen our country, our unity, our courage and our efforts.
Our common duty and responsibility is to implement the strategy flawlessly and overcome this test without failures!
Dear fellow citizens!
Kazakhstan of the 21st century is a country created from scratch in just two decades by talented, hardworking and tolerant people!
This is our creation in which we take huge pride!
It is our great creation that we wholeheartedly love!
We’ve adopted Strategy-2050 so that Kazakhstan’s people can hold firmly in their hands the helm of the country's future.
Today, many successful countries – China, Malaysia and Turkey – follow their long-term strategies.
Strategic planning is a ‘number one’ rule in the 21st century, because no wind will be favorable unless a country does not know its route and destination harbor.
Strategy Kazakhstan 2050, as a guiding beacon, allows us to solve our people’s everyday issues, while also keeping our priority aims in mind.
This means that we should improve the life of our nation not in 30 or 50 years’ time, but do so every year.
The Strategy is a program of concrete practical actions, which on a daily basis will improve our country and the life of every citizen of Kazakhstan.
However, everyone must understand that, in market conditions, we must work effectively, rather than wait for manna from heaven.
The government’s task is to provide all conditions for this.
I am convinced that the prosperous future of our homeland lies among developed countries.
Today, I want to present our plan for joining the 30 most developed countries of the world.
On my instruction, the Government has drafted a detailed plan for Kazakhstan to take its place among the top 30 countries.
I gave my overall endorsement to this document, which will be finally approved after revision to fit my instructions in this Address.
According to many forecasts, the next 15-17 years will be a window of opportunity for large-scale breakthrough development of Kazakhstan.
During this period, we will have a favorable external environment, rising demand for resources, energy and food, and the growth of the Third Industrial Revolution.
We should make benefit of this time.
The process of achieving the goals for 2050 will proceed against the background of intense global competition.
Forthcoming decades will bring many well-known challenges, as well as numerous unexpected situations, new crises in global markets and world politics.
There will be no easy ride in the 21st century.
The middle of the century is already not too distant.
Developed countries take this into account in their specific strategies.
The second third of the 21st century will definitely be more difficult, and the number of candidates to the global list of top 30 will be very limited.
I have repeatedly noted that the concept of a developed country is a category that changes over time.
In developed countries, we see fundamentally new qualities in the life of people.
Today the member states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) represent basic indicators of developed countries.
This organization brings together 34 countries that produce more than 60 percent of global GDP.
There are six more candidates to join the OECD: Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa.
The OECD member countries have undergone the path of deep modernization. They now demonstrate high rates of investment, scientific research, productivity, a large share of small and medium-sized businesses, and high standards of living.
These indicators of OECD countries provide a natural benchmark for Kazakhstan on our way to joining the top 30 developed nations of the world.
I set the task to introduce in Kazakhstan a number of principles and standards of the OECD.
They are reflected in the draft Plan.
In our economy, we plan to reach annual GDP growth not less than four percent.
We should increase the volume of investment from the current 18 percent of the country’s GDP to 30 percent.
The development of knowledge-based economy aims to see the share of non-oil products in Kazakhstan's export potential rise to 70 percent.
The development of new high-tech sectors of the economy will require increase in financing of science to the minimum level of 3 percent of GDP.
It is necessary to halve the energy intensity of the GDP.
By 2050, small and medium-sized businesses will produce at least 50 percent of Kazakhstan's GDP, instead of the current 20 percent.
Labor productivity should grow five-fold, from the current $24,500 to $126,000.
The main benchmarks of the SOCIAL SECTOR development until 2050 are provided in concrete indicators.
We should increase by 4.5 times our GDP per capita, from $13,000 to $60,000.
Kazakhstan will become a country where the middle class makes up a predominant share of the population.
Following the global trend, the share of our urban population will increase from the current 55 percent to roughly 70 percent.
The cities and settlements of Kazakhstan will be linked by high-quality roads and high-speed transport.
The maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, and advances in medicine will help increase the life expectancy in Kazakhstan to 80 years and above.
Kazakhstan will become one of the leading Eurasian centers of medical tourism.
The building of an advanced and competitive national educational system will be completed.
Kazakhstan has to become one of the most SAFE AND COMFORTABLE COUNTRIES FOR LIVING.
Peace and stability, justice and rule of law are the basis of a developed country.
Fellow citizens!
Our Plan for Kazakhstan joining the top 30 developed countries of the world includes long-term priorities for our activity.
It requires us to address a number of challenges in the following priority areas.
FIRST.
It is important to adjust and strengthen the trend of innovative industrialization.
I gave instructions to the Government to design a draft of the Second Five-Year Plan for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development for 2016-2019.
We need to limit the number of priorities for industrialization.
It is important to increase the effectiveness of traditional mining sectors.
They are our natural competitive advantage.
We need to adopt new approaches to the management, production and processing of hydrocarbons, to maximize the export potential of the energy sector.
We need to make final decisions on possible future scenarios for oil and gas production.
It is important to increase the development of rare earth metals, taking into account their importance for knowledge-based industries – electronics, laser technology, telecommunications and medical equipment.
Kazakhstan should enter the world market of geological exploration.
We need to attract investment from foreign engineering companies to this industry by simplifying legislation.
In general, we should have separate plans for the development of traditional industries.
Each of the next five-year plans should end up with an emergence of new industries in our economy.
During the first five-year plan, we developed production capability in the automotive and aircraft industries, as well as locomotives, passenger and freight car production.
We should expand these products and export them to external markets.
So, the remaining years until 2050 are divided into seven five-year periods, each aimed at achieving the goal of becoming one of top 30 developed countries.
During the second and subsequent five-year plans, we should establish the industries of mobile and multimedia technology, nanotechnology and space technology, robotics, genetic engineering, and future energy exploration.
The key priority of the Government’s work is to create most favorable conditions for Kazakhstan's business, mainly small and medium-sized enterprises.
In the next 10-15 years, it is necessary to develop a knowledge-intensive basis for the economy. Without this basis we cannot join the group of developed countries.
And it must be founded on advanced science.
SECOND.
We need to ensure that our AGRICULTURE takes the path of innovations.
This is our traditional industry.
The global demand for food will increase.
This sector will attract more investment.
This will enable farmers to look beyond short-term weather-related achievements to the long-term growth of production.
Competition in the global agro-production will intensify.
Agricultural lands should be used by those who introduce new technologies, continuously improve productivity, and perform on the basis of the best international standards.
First and foremost, it is important to develop an effective land market, particularly through transparent pricing mechanisms.
Once investment and introduction of advanced technologies become pre-requisites for farmland leasing, it will increase competition.
We should remove all barriers that impede business development in agriculture, farmers’ cooperation and efficient land use.
The future lies in the creation of a network of new processing enterprises in the agricultural sector, mainly in the form of small and medium-sized businesses.
In this area we should provide loans to business.
Farmers should have direct access to long-term financing and markets without intermediaries.
Also important is the creation of an effective system of guarantees and insurance of loans to rural producers.
Kazakhstan should become a major regional exporter of meat, dairy and farming products.
In crop farming, we should reduce the volume of unprofitable water-intensive crops cultivation and switch to vegetable, oilseed and forage production.
We need a set of measures to drive the efficient use of agrochemicals, and increased use of modern technology of zero tillage and other innovations in arid regions.
According to the Plan for the transition to the green economy by 2030, 15 percent of acreage will be converted to water-saving technologies.
We need to develop agricultural science and create experimental agro-innovation clusters.
It is important to keep up with the pace of time, and along with the production of natural food, develop drought-tolerant, genetically modified crops.
Given the designated tasks, I charge the Government to adjust the planning for agriculture development.
THIRD.
The development of knowledge-based economy is, above all, the increase of the capacity of science in Kazakhstan.
In this area we should improve legislation on venture financing, intellectual property protection, research and innovation support, as well as commercialization of research.
I charge the Government before September 1 of this year to develop and submit to the Parliament a package of relevant bills.
We need a concrete plan for the gradual increase of science financing for specific research and scientific discoveries.
To accelerate the transfer of knowledge and new technologies to the country, we need to fully use the potential of foreign direct investment.
In cooperation with foreign companies we need to set up design and engineering centers.
We need to invite the leading transnational companies operating in major oil and gas and mining facilities to establish production facilities for their own needs and services here, in Kazakhstan.
I know some large companies are ready for this.
The Government must elaborate on this issue and provide favorable conditions for the process if necessary.
There is no need to import equipment from abroad, if we can produce it in our country.
It is important to improve the efficiency of the national innovation system and its basic institutions.
Their activities should be oriented to supporting start-ups and venture deals at early stages.
It is necessary to increase activity in technology parks, mainly in large urban agglomerations, primarily in Astana and Almaty.
In Astana, the first intellectual innovation cluster is already successfully operating around Nazarbayev University.
In Almaty there is an Alatau Information Technology Park.
We need to think about bringing spin-off production sites of large local companies into the clusters.
FOURTH.
We have to ensure dynamic development of the infrastructure triad — AGGLOMERATIONS, TRANSPORTATION, AND ENERGY.
Agglomerations are the foundation of the knowledge-based economy of Kazakhstan.
Their creation and development are an important challenge given the vast territory of our country and its low population density.
The largest cities of Kazakhstan, Astana and Almaty, Shymkent and Aktobe must become contemporary urban centers driving economic growth.
They should become centers of science and investment, attract talent, and provide high-quality education, healthcare, social, and cultural services.
Transport infrastructure is at the heart of industrial economy and society.
I have said many times that it is impossible to reach the level of a developed country without modern high-quality highways.
As we are located between Europe and Asia, between the North and the South, transportation remains of great importance to Kazakhstan.
To set up a network of internal roads, we have initiated construction of highways Astana-Karaganda-Almaty, Astana-Pavlodar-Ust’-Kamenogorsk, Almaty-Kapchagay-Ust-Kamenogorsk.
These routes are already used by trains that are twice as fast.
We need to develop the logistics services sector.
First of all, it is a question of the maximum use of the Customs Union territory for transportation of our goods.
The construction works of the Western Europe – Western China corridor are coming to an end. We have built a new railway to Turkmenistan and Iran with an access to the Persian Gulf.
In the future, Kazakhstan must invest in the creation of logistics centers in countries with access to the sea.
It is necessary to reduce the customs clearance time for goods, increase the capacity of border checkpoints, strengthen the efficiency of the Aktau seaport, and simplify exporting and importing procedures.
We are constructing the new 1200 km long railway Zhezkazghan – Shalkar – Beineu.
This railway will connect the country’s west and east, reviving activities in the regional centers.
This grand construction is to be completed in 2015.
These routes will enable us, through the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus, to reach Europe and, in the East, the Lianyungang seaport bordering the Pacific Ocean, upon which there is an agreement with the People’s Republic of China.
We are going to develop the traditional energy sector.
It is necessary to support research in cleaning fossil-fuel power plants’ emissions and in energy saving, in industry and household, based on the most sophisticated technologies.
Recently, ten largest companies of the European Union publicly opposed the EU energy strategy based on the well-known concept of the green economy.
Over the four years of its implementation, the European Union has lost 51 gigawatt of energy power.
In our green energy program, we have to take into account all of these mistakes.
Preparation for the international exhibition EXPO 2017 in Astana should be used to establish a center for the study and implementation of the world’s best research and the creation of future energy.
A team of specialists, under the auspices of Nazarbayev University, should lead this work.
We should create conditions for the transition of our public transport to environmentally friendly fuels, introduce electric cars, and create the necessary infrastructure for them.
The country needs large-scale production of gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation kerosene.
We need to construct a new oil-processing refinery.
At the same time, we should not forget about development of nuclear energy.
The demand for cheap nuclear energy, in the foreseeable future, will only increase.
Kazakhstan is the world leader in uranium production.
We have to develop our own fuel industry and build nuclear power stations.
FIFTH.
SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS development is the main tool for the industrial and social modernization of Kazakhstan in the 21st century.
In this respect my position, as it is known, is well-defined, and I have expressed it many times.
The greater the share of small-to-medium-sized businesses in our economy is, the more developed and sustainable Kazakhstan will be.
Currently we have more than 800,000 small-to-medium-size enterprises employing 2.4 million of our citizens.
Production in this sector has increased 1.6 times over the past four years and equals more than 8.3 billion tenge.
According to the global ranking, Kazakhstan has joined the group of countries with the most favorable conditions for doing business. We have to reinforce this trend.
Small and medium-sized business is the economic basis of our Universal Labor Society.
For its development we need to comprehensively address private property rights.
It is necessary to repeal all the outdated legal norms impeding business development.
Small business should become a family tradition, passed down from generation to generation.
It is important to support the specialization of small business as they grow in size.
We need clear bankruptcy procedures for such enterprises.
Small and medium-sized business should develop around new innovative companies.
I charged the Government to combine the next five-year industrialization plan with the Business road map 2020.
The Government, together with the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan, should establish effective support mechanisms for new entrepreneurs.
SIXTH.
Our path to the future is related to creating NEW OPPORTUNITIES to UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL of our citizens.
A developed country in the 21st century has active, educated, enterprising and healthy citizens.
What do we need to achieve this?
First, all developed countries have a unique high-quality education system.
We have a great deal of work to do to improve the quality of all parts of national education.
By 2020 we expect all Kazakhstan’s children from three to six years to be in preschool education.
Therefore it is important to provide these children with modern education methods and qualified personnel.
In the secondary education, it is necessary to improve the standard of teaching in all schools to the level of Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools.
High school graduates should speak Kazakh, Russian and English.
The result of teaching should be mastery of critical thinking skills, independent research and in-depth analysis of information.
In the period up to 2017, we need to eliminate the lack of space in schools and convert schools to a two-shift study system where it is necessary.
Government and akims (governors) should adjust the budgetary allocation to this task.
In the next two-three years, we need to create a core of a national system of dual technical and professional education.
We need to move to a guarantee by the government of a technical education for young people.
I charge the Government to submit concrete proposals on this issue by June 1, 2014.
We need to start a gradual transition of our leading universities to academic and administrative autonomy.
I believe it necessary to establish an effective system of student support for high performers.
I charge the Government to provide the increase of scholarships by 25 percent from January 1, 2016.
Second, the main priority in healthcare is primary care services.
The introduction of compulsory health insurance should be considered.
The joint responsibility of the state, the employer and the employee for his/her health is the main principle of the entire health care system.
Sports, proper diet, regular preventive examinations are the foundation of disease prevention.
Thirdly, we must provide new impetus for Kazakhstan’s cultural development.
The long-term Concept of the cultural policy should be developed.
It is necessary to identify measures aimed at creating a competitive cultural mentality of the Kazakhstan people and the development of modern cultural clusters.
Kazakh language has become the language of science, knowledge and Internet.
The number of students studying in Kazakh has increased over the years.
There are now 57 centers across the country that teach the state language.
Thousands of citizens have learned Kazakh in these centers, and there are people who are in the process of learning the language.
This year, the number of representatives of other ethnicities who speak Kazakh has increased by 10 percent, compared with last year.
It reveals the important changes that are underway.
Only over the past three years, 10 billion tenge was allocated across the country to develop the state language.
There is one fact that no one can change!
Our native language has become the Eternal Language in our Eternal Land.
We should consider it not as a ground for debates, but as a foundation to unite our country.
Fourth, we should revise social packages for people working in education, healthcare and social security sectors.
I charge the Government to develop and implement a new model of pay system for civil servants from July 1, 2015.
It should provide an increase in the salaries of healthcare employees by 28 percent, in the education sector – by 29 percent, and in the social security sector – by 40 percent.
Fifth, we must do more to support our citizens with disabilities.
Kazakhstan must become a barrier-free zone for them.
It is our duty to take care of those people.
The countries around the world tackle these issues.
People with disabilities can work in the service sector, food processing and agriculture industries.
I am calling upon our businesses to encourage the employment of people with disabilities.
An introduction of a special quota of up to five-ten people should be considered.
We will incorporate these people into active life, and they will not only receive disability benefits, but also feel themselves full-fledged members of the society.
All social institutions, non-profit organizations, and the Nur Otan party have to start addressing this issue.
The Government needs to coordinate the process with other actors and make respective decisions.
I charge the Government to increase by 25 percent the amount of social benefits for those with disabilities and those who lost their breadwinner, starting July 1, 2015.
The legal framework for associations of disabled persons should be improved.
All government entities - from the Central Government to the local akims – should intensify this work.
We must continue reducing poverty and tackling unemployment.
At the same time, it is important not to allow welfare mentality to grow.
For all recipients of state allowances and aid, it is necessary to introduce a rule for mandatory participation in employment programs and social adaptation.
SEVENTH.
Improving PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.
As we move towards the top 30 developed countries, we need an atmosphere of creativity, fair competition, rule of law, and high standards of legal culture.
We need renewed instruments of interaction between the state, the non-government sector and business.
Equality before the law should become the real basis of the law and order.
The judicial system should become transparent and accessible in practice, resolving all disputes in a simple and rapid manner.
It is necessary to increase the quality of the entire law enforcement system.
Men in uniform, provided with great authority, have to demonstrate high standards of behavior and professionalism.
An important task is to create and implement the new anti-corruption strategy.
Administrative reform should not turn into a cumbersome process of unnecessary paperwork and document circulation.
We should give more independence to local authorities, while increasing their responsibility for results and their accountability to the people.
I charge the Government, together with my Administration, to submit a set of proposals on all these issues by 1 July 2014.
It is necessary to keep on putting into practice the meritocracy principles in the management of human resources in state-owned enterprises, national companies, and state budget-financed organizations.
I charge the Government to ensure the wages of the B corps civil servants grow by 15% since 1 July 2015, and by another 15% since 1 July 2016.
These are clear goals our country and our society will face on their way to the top 30 developed countries.
We will have to translate them into relevant legislation and concrete actions.
Distinguished Members of Parliament and Government!
Our movement towards the top 30 developed countries should proceed in two stages.
The first stage embraces the period before 2030, during which we will have to make a modernization breakthrough using a window of opportunity in the 21st century.
It requires Kazakhstan to achieve what the developed countries accomplished during the industrial boom of the last century.
This is feasible.
South Korea and Singapore followed this path.
At this stage, we will ensure dynamic growth of our traditional sectors and create a strong manufacturing industry.
During the second stage, between 2030 and 2050, we need to ensure sustainable development of the country on the principles of the knowledge-based economy.
We will build a strong manufacturing industry.
In our traditional sectors, we will move to high-end products. Engineering services will be developed as a basis for the knowledge-based economy.
Now I want to focus on what has to be done this year, taking into account that our future achievements depend on how well we begin.
I am charging the Government and the National Bank with seven specific tasks.
First.
The Government has to ensure the economic growth of 6-7%.
This year, GDP per capita will have to be not less than $14,500.
Second.
By May 1, 2014, the National Bank, together with the Government, has to develop a set of measures to bring inflation down to 3-4% in the medium term.
Third.
By June 1, 2014, the Government and the National Bank have to develop a comprehensive financial sector development program to run until 2030.
Fourth.
The Government, together with the Fund Samruk-Kazyna, should analyse all state-owned companies, define a list of enterprises to be privatized.
The same work should be done for the rest of the public sector.
In the first quarter of the current year, a comprehensive privatization program for 2014-2016 has to be adopted.
Fifth.
By the end of the year, the Government has to prepare draft strategies on the formation of agglomerations in Astana and Almaty for the period until 2030.
Sixth.
By September 1, 2014, the Government has to prepare Kazakhstan’s transit potential development program until 2030, envisaging the removal of barriers to international trade.
Seventh.
By the end of the first quarter of this year, the Government has to agree on the location, investment sources, and construction schedule for a nuclear power plant and fourth oil refinery.
Fellow citizens!
My comrades-in-arms!
All our actions designed to reach the main goal of the 2050 Strategy have to follow clear principles.
Firstly, pragmatism and the evolutionary nature of all decisions.
No leaps, thoughtless experiments or adventures should be accepted in the economy, politics, or social life.
Our country and society will change as fast as the surrounding world.
Secondly, mutually beneficial openness.
We will attract a wide range of foreign investments, technologies, and innovations to our economy.
We will create favorable conditions for the investors.
We see the deepening integration of our economy in regional and global economic systems as an important mechanism for joining the top 30 developed countries.
This is, above all, linked to our participation in building the Eurasian Economic Union and joining the World Trade Organization.
Thirdly, reinforcing our citizens’ wellbeing.
The social conditions of ordinary people should be the most important indicator of our progress towards the major goal.
Fourthly, nationwide support is very important.
My Address to the people is in itself the main document explaining our goals and objectives.
Each minister, local governor and company head has to explain and lead these activities and involve everyone they manage in this work.
Each citizen has to be informed of specific measures that are taken in order to achieve the goals stated in the Address.
To this end, first of all, public servants have to know and be imbued with the ideas of our Strategy.
The President’s Administration and the Government have to work to enable the achievement of all of these objectives.
On the whole, the structure of public institutions has to fit the achievement of the goals ahead of us and make sure we achieve the 2050 Strategy goals.
Fellow citizens!
We, the people of Kazakhstan, are a united nation!
And our shared destiny - our Mangilik Yel or the Eternal Land – is our great country of Kazakhstan!
Mangilik Yel is the national idea of our shared Kazakh home.
Over the past 22 years of our sovereignty and development we have formed our core values, they are the foundation of our country’s future and unite all the people of Kazakhstan.
They are not taken from mystical stories or theories.
These values are the embodiment of Kazakhstan’s Way, which has withstood the test of time.
First of all, it is the independence of Kazakhstan and our Astana.
Second, our national unity, peace and harmony are foremost in our society.
Third, it is a secular society with high spirituality.
Fourth, economic growth based on industrialization and innovation.
Fifth, it is the Universal Labor Society.
Sixth, we have a common history, culture and language.
Seventh, it is our country’s national security and its engagement in addressing global and regional issues.
With these values, we have triumphed, strengthened our country, multiplied our achievements.
There is an ideological foundation of the New Kazakhstan Patriotism in these state forming and nationwide values.
I charge the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan, together with the National Movement Kazakhstan - 2050, to organize the drafting and adoption of a Patriot Act Mangilik Yel.
I call upon all political parties, public associations, all the citizens of Kazakhstan to actively participate in the achievement of the main goals of the Strategy - 2050!
I particularly appeal to our youth.
This strategy is for you.
You, who will participate in its implementation, and you will reap the benefits of its success.
Get involved in these efforts, each in your workplace.
Do not be indifferent.
Help create the destiny of the country together with the whole nation!
My dear fellow citizens!
Mangilik Yel (the Eternal Land) has been a precious dream for many thousands of years.
It is a dream of becoming an Independent Country that has equal relations with other countries and has its own place on the world map.
It is a dream of becoming a happy country that allows its citizens to have fulfilling lives and to look at the future with faith.
We have made our dreams come true.
We have laid the foundation of the Eternal Land.
I noticed people asking What should be the national idea of the people ofKazakhstan?
There is an idea that shows us the direction to the future, that consolidates the nation and leads to the accomplishment of great ambitions.
It is the idea of Mangilik Yel – the Eternal Land.
With Independence, we have accomplished our Great Ambitions.
We have founded our Eternal Capital - the heart of our country, the base of our independence.
The achievements of Kazakh people (Mangilik Gumur) will help us build The Great Future (Mangilik Bolashak).
The next generation is the children of the Great Kazakh people.
Therefore, the national idea of Kazakhstan is the Eternal Land!
The concept of the Eternal Land (Mangilik El) is the foundation of the nation’s great course – strategy Kazakhstan-2050.
It is more difficult to sustain the independence than to achieve it.
It is a centuries-old truth, proved by many nations in the world.
Mutual hostility and lack of cohesion have caused the disappearance of many nations.
Many nations are lost forever having been unable to withstand the tests of time.
We must learn from the mistakes of others and draw lessons from the past.
One lesson is that the creation of the Eternal Land lies in our own hands.
We need to encourage ourselves to keep moving forward.
We absolutely must preserve our Undeniable Independence, that is our wealth and our happiness.
Kazakhstan – 2050 is the most honorary and the most decent way to lead to the Eternal Land.
Let’s not move away from this path, my dear nation!
May everyday be festive and every effort be beneficial!
May the development be rapid and the future be prosperous!
May our country continue to surprise the world with its great achievements!

Today President Nursultan Nazarbayev Takes Part in International Conference Titled From a Nuclear Test Ban to a Nuclear Weapon-Free World
participation in events
The participants from 70 countries of the world who represent all continents attended the conference.
Conference participants included prominent politicians, scientists, parliamentarians and representatives from inter-parliamentary organizations.
Among them are Head of the UN Regional Center for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia Miroslav Jenca, Chairwoman of the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation Valentina Matviyenko, Foreign Minister of Germany Guido Westerwelle, US Congressman Eni Faleomavaega, and Chairman of the Middle Powers Initiative Douglas Roche.
In his speech the President of Kazakhstan recalled that the International Day against Nuclear Tests is currently observed for third time worldwide.
The Day was established by the UN General Assembly resolution, which was presented at the initiative of Kazakhstan, the first country in history to have closed the nuclear test site.
This historical act made by the will of the people of our country 21 years ago has great civilization significance.
It was Kazakhstan’s decisive step towards its real sovereignty and independence.
Nuclear weapons and radiation was far from being a distant theory for the people of Kazakhstan.
It was a terrible and inexorable evil that had been devastating our land for more than four decades.
A total of nearly 500 nuclear explosions of the so-called peaceful purposes were carried out in the atmosphere, underground and above ground on the test site.
This is half of all the tests carried out in the world during the existence of nuclear weapons.
Day-to-day radiation poisoned steppes, rivers and lakes, slowly destroying all life around. The Nuclear Devil caused harmful damages to more than one and a half million of people who lived around the test site.
The tragic consequences of nuclear testing are felt to this day, the President said.
The head of state also stressed that the closure of the Semipalatinsk nuclear polygon launched a new stage of global process of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
Sixteen years ago, by the UN resolution the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was opened for signature.
Kazakhstan was one of the first to have signed it.
Moreover, President Nazarbayev emphasized that nowadays a reduction of global nuclear security strengthening process is being observed.
We have not reached the universality of the non-proliferation regime.
New nuclear and some threshold countries are still not included in the Treaty.
Two years ago, the United States and Russia signed the Prague Treaty which furthered a Strategic Arms Reduction process.
However, this did not become an example for other nuclear-weapon states.
The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) can’t come into force.
Signatures of only a few threshold group countries are needed for it to become operative.
The issue of the global monitoring of the development of national nuclear power programs remains unregulated.
The accident at Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant last year clearly outlined for the whole world the problem of technology gap in ensuring safety at the facilities of peaceful atom, the President said.
The head of state emphasized that the twenty-first century is impossible without nuclear power.
The solution of problems of poverty, unemployment, lack of food is related to the implementation of projects of peaceful nuclear energy, of course, under the strict control of the UN and the IAEA.
That is why our idea of a nuclear-free world has nothing to do with the radio phobia or utopian desire to ever forget the secret of energy fission.
The nuclear-free world is a complete ban on the military use of nuclear energy.
This is the essence of my proposal on the development and adoption of the Universal Declaration of a nuclear-free world.
I remain a consistent supporter of this idea, the President concluded.
Besides, the President also pointed out that the acquiring of freedom from the fear of nuclear self-destruction should become an important initiative of the G-GLOBAL forum established by Kazakhstan.
In particular, a step-by-step plan of comprehensive arms reduction with participation of all nuclear states that should be drawn out and adopted by the UN is necessary.
The nuclear test ban treaty should be enter into force as well.
It is important to work out mechanisms of promotion of states that had cancelled their military nuclear programs.
The President laid a special emphasis on the fact that a nuclear-weapon-free world is our common goal to which the whole mankind should strive for.
For this purpose, today Kazakhstan is launching its international project called ATOM.
The name of the project ATOM is an acronym formed of the first four letters in the English language which reads as Abolish Testing. Our Mission.
As part of this project, anyone in the world who stands against nuclear weapons can sign an online petition addressing the world’s governments to call for a complete ban of nuclear tests and thus, to procure a faster adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
I call the participants of the conference and all the people of the world to support ATOM project and make building of a nuclear weapons-free world our most important goal, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
In conclusion of his speech, the President called upon to actively participate in the interactive discussion under the G-GLOBAL format.
Within the framework of this format millions of users have a dialogue on a wide range of issues on formation in the twenty-first century a new, fair world order, an important component of which will be a nuclear-free world.

President Nursultan Nazarbayev Receives a Group of Majilis Deputies of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Events
Deputies Vladimir Bobrov, Zhaksylyk Doskaliev, Gulmira Isimbayeva and Rauan Shaekin reported to the President on legislation work targeted at the implementation of the Presidential Address.
Zhaksylyk Doskaliev, the Chairman of the Committee for social-cultural development of Majilis informed the President that budget expenditures on social sphere increased due to economic growth.
The deputy informed that expenditures on public health care were equal to 131 billion tenges in 2004. This year, 391 billion tenges will be spent on the development of the public health care system.
People there are glad and express their gratitude to you, Zhaksylyk Doskaliev said.
The President noted that increasing the life expectancy and decreasing the mortality rates are the main objectives of Kazakhstan’s public health care system.
It is necessary to focus on five groups of diseases that are main reasons of the high mortality rates of Kazakhstan’s population namely those are cardiovascular diseases, infections, traumas, oncology, child and maternity mortality.
The State Program for reforming and developing the public health care system of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2005-2010 implies a better supplement of public health care organizations with modern pharmaceutical production that will be distributed free of charge for some groups of population, construction of 156 public health care objects including 144 in rural area, reconstruction of 3000 thousands of ambulance organizations.
This is a significant support.
These allocated funds and their distribution must be under deputies’ control, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
Member of the Committee for social-economic development of Majilis Gulmira Isimbayeva reported to the President on the situation in Kazakhstan’s educational system.
The teacher is the key element of school education.
Now, their wage amounts correspond to administrative economy.
We introduced a bill to the Government that suggests an adaptation of wage rates to market economy and will link teachers’ salaries to the quality of education, Gulmira Isimbayeva said.
The President stressed that wage amounts must be differentiated according to the received results.
An administrative reform is being implemented in Kazakhstan that establishes a dependence of the wage amount on the quality of work.
The same approach must be introduced everywhere including education and medicine, Nursultan Nazarbayev underscored.
Deputy Rauan Shaekin informed the President on the development of social-entrepreneurial corporations (SEC).
Currently, there are seven SECs in seven macroregions of Kazakhstan namely Saryarka, Zhetisu, Ertis, Ontustik, Caspiy, Tobyl and Batys.
Rauan Shaekin also said that it is not clear to some businessmen what form of private property will be assigned to those enterprises in the structure of social-entrepreneurial corporations, which will be established with the participation of private capital.

Events
I have invited you to the final conversation in order to thank you for your participation in the working group.
Your life experience and authority have played a significant role in forming those amendments to the Constitution that I am going to announce at the joint sitting of the Parliament’s chambers this week.
Most of the suggestions offered by you have been taken into account.
They concern several issues.
First, this is a redistribution of presidential authorities to the Parliament and election system.
Second, this is the role of political parties.
Third, this is the increasing important role of local self-governing.
Fourth, this is the further development of law-enforcement system.
And fifth, this is the development of guarantees of human freedoms and rights.
We have tried to make serious amendments according to these five issues, and we think that we are ready to do this, - the President said while opening the sitting.
A decision to submit the legislation bill on making amendments and additions to the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan for consideration to the Parliament’s chambers has been made as a result of the sitting.
The amendments refer primarily to the section covering the Parliament’s authorities.
The Parliament’s authorities will be broadened in such a degree that it is possible to say that there will be a transfer from the presidential form to presidential parliamentary form of governing.
The role of political factions is going to be considerably broadened in the legislation process and forming the Government.
The role of political parties is going to be more important; the number of deputies will be increased both in Majilis and Senate.
The accurate number is not known yet, because this is the President’s prerogative to announce it.
The number will be announced in the Parliament when the amendments will be submitted for consideration.
The role of social unions increases.
A number of the project’s articles concern rights and freedoms of human and citizen.
There are amendments that relate to forming courts, and as a result many articles are simplified and the independence of judicial system is guaranteed.
An amendment is going to be made to the functioning of law-enforcement system on the whole and particularly, to regulations on activities of public prosecutor office, preliminary investigations bodies, and investigation organs.
Excessive concretization of a variety of constitutional norms is excluded, and these questions will be covered by constitutional and other laws.
On the whole, the amendments will allow to democratize our state and society to a higher degree, and ensure more reliable protection of constitutional rights and freedoms of human and citizen, - Chairman of the Constitutional Council Igor Rogov said at a briefing.

Such kindergartens will be continuously built in all regions, cities and precincts.

Today, when we are talking about 12 year education, we suppose that necessary knowledge for the first grade children are getting in preparatory institutions; kindergartens are ones of them.
It is very important that there are gymnasiums, pools in kindergartens; children can learn foreign languages, a special attention is paid to the state language, - the Head of the State emphasized.

Nyrly Zhol – The Path to the Future
Dear people of Kazakhstan,
The world is facing new challenges and threats today.
The world economy has still not recovered from consequences of the global financial and economic crisis.
The recovery continues at a very slow and uncertain pace, and some countries remain in decline.
The geopolitical crisis and the sanctions policy of the leading powers create an additional obstacle for the recovery of the world economy.
From my experience, I feel that the years to come will become the time of global trials.
The entire architecture of the world will be changing.
Not all countries will be able to get through these complications in a decent manner.
Only strong states, with their people united, will manage to do that.
Kazakhstan, as a part of the world economy and a country located very close to the epicentre of geopolitical tensions, is experiencing negative pressure from all these challenges.
We see the results: prices in global markets are dropping, and general economic growth is slowing down.
As is known, the forecasts of the development of the global economy for 2014 and the next two years were revised downward by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
That means we need to revise our own plans, and make adjustments for the coming period.
There is no time for hesitation.
The measures I will talk about today will be implemented from January 1, 2015.
We must promptly take all the possible measures to prevent negative trends.
Today the Government is already working quickly at my order.
We have revised the parameters of the republic’s budget for 2015.
And this is right, as the drop in prices of our export raw materials has led to the reduction of the flow of money to our income.
At the same time, the Government have a tough yet specific task: it must fulfil all social liabilities in full.
In a crisis, as we’re seeing the world over, economic policies must be re-evaluated.
The sectors that need support are those which create the highest multiplier effect on economic growth and employment.
We have already had such an experience.
Suffice it to recall our successful anti-crisis measures in 2007-2009.
As you see, life makes adjustments to the best laid plans.
And we should add new content to the platform of our party based on today’s reality.
On my orders, the Government has completed the development of a new large-scale development programme.
Today, as we respond to the challenges we face, I proclaim Kazakhstan’s New Economic Policy Nyrly Zhol (The Bright Road).
This is what I devote my state-of-the-nation address for 2015.
The policy will have a counter-cyclical character and will be aimed at continuing structural reforms in our economy.
What does this mean?
Over the years, when the situation in external markets was favourable, and the price of oil and our export products were at sufficiently high level, we diverted revenues from those exports to the National Fund.
One of the main tasks of the National Fund is to increase resistance of our economy to external shocks, including when prices of natural resources drop.
We were putting income from extraction and sales of raw materials into this Fund during all these years.
We used 10 billion US dollars out of the National Fund to fight the crisis of 2007-2009.
As for the rest of the money, we have not spent it. We saved and multiplied it.
Now we are in the period when we must use these reserves.
They will help overcome uneasy times and stimulate the growth of our economy.
These resources are not intended for short-term measures.
We will spend them on the transformation of our economy, namely – the development of transport, energy, industrial and social infrastructure, and small and medium businesses.
In February, a decision was made to allocate one trillion tenge from the National Fund to support economic growth and employment in 2014-2015 in two tranches of 500 billion tenge.
To finalise the initiated projects and resolve pressing issues, I have instructed the Government to divert the second tranche of 500 billion tenge from the National Fund to the following goals:
First, 100 billion tenge should be additionally allocated to issue easy-term loans to small and medium businesses, as well as large enterprises.
This will secure the implementation of projects in the food and chemical industries, engineering, as well as the service sector.
Second, to revive the banking sector and buy out bad loans, I have ordered additional capitalisation of the Fund of Problem Loans in the amount of 250 billion tenge in 2015.
Third, to raise new investments, we need to improve respective conditions.
For these purposes, I have ordered the government to allocate 81 billion tenge in 2015 to complete the construction of the dry port complex, the infrastructure of the special economic zones at Khorgos – East Gate and the National Industrial Petrochemical Technological Park in Atyrau and Taraz.
Fourth, to continue the construction of the EXPO-2017, I have ordered the allocation of 40 billion tenge in 2015 adding to the already allocated 25 billion tenge.
Fifth, on the eve of EXPO-2017, we need to take care of the development of Astana’s transport infrastructure.
This year the capital airport will reach its maximum capacity – 3.5 million people.
Therefore, to increase its potential, I have ordered the allocation in 2015 of 29 billion tenge on the construction of a new terminal and a reconstruction of the landing strip.
This will allow us to increase airport capacity to 7.1 million of passengers per year by 2017.
Dear people of Kazakhstan,
In view of new external risks for the development of our economy, we need new initiatives to stimulate business activity and employment.
The Infrastructure Development Plan, which I want to make public today, will become the core of the New Economic Policy.
It is intended to last for five years and is to run in parallel with the Second Five Year term of the Programme of Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development. More than 100 foreign companies intend to participate in its implementation.
The total investment portfolio will make 6 trillion tenge, with the state contributing 15 per cent of the total.
Kazakhstan owns a territory so vast it would tire the wings of a bird to fly over it.
Thus, this plan requires huge funds and hard work.
There is a saying: If you want to know a nation’s prosperity look at its paths.
Road connections are of high importance, not only for travel, but also for the transportation of goods.
In ancient times our big cities were located along the Great Silk Road.
Nowadays, all essential life depends on access to the main highways.
Roads are the essence of life, the source of a modern existence.
All the regions of Kazakhstan need to be closely connected by railroads, highways, and air services.
The nine roads, connecting with each other in Astana are like the roots of life, spread our capital’s creative spirit.
Improving interconnectivity between the regions will eventually lead to a greater domestic well-being.
It will strengthen trade and economic ties between the regions.
There will be new markets emerging from inside the country.
Therefore bringing together distant parts is the main focus of today’s address.
First, the development of transport and logistics infrastructure will be formed around regional hubs, connected through Astana as the central hub and backbone by highways, railways and airlines.
But first, we need to implement the main road projects.
They are Western China to Western Europe; Astana to Almaty; Astana to Ust-Kamenogorsk; Astana to Aktobe to Atyrau; Almay to Ust-Kamenogorsk; Karaganda to Zhezkazgan to Kyzylorda; Atyrau to Astrakhan.
It is also necessary to continue the creation of a logistical hub in the east and marine infrastructure in the west of the country.
The large-scale ferry site from Kuryk and the railway line from Borzhakty to Yersai will contribute to the growth of exports to the west through ports in the Caspian Sea.
I have ordered the Government to work on the construction or rental of terminals at dry and sea ports in China, Iran, Russia and the EU.
Second, development of industrial infrastructure.
The implementation of infrastructure projects will produce big demand for construction materials, products and services for transport, communication, energy, housing and utility areas.
So, firstly, we need to complete our work on the formation of infrastructure in existing special economic zones.
The Government and the akims (governors) need to work in a timely manner to fill those zones with concrete projects.
Secondly, they need to explore the possibility of constructing new industrial zones in regions aimed at the development of production facilities of SMEs and raising extra investments.
Tourism infrastructure is a separate line.
Its main advantage is the opportunity to create jobs.
The creation of one job here costs 10 times less than in industry.
Third, the development of energy infrastructure.
Extensive work has been carried out within the framework of the industrialisation programme in energy in the past five years.
Nevertheless, limited transmission systems create a deficit of electric energy in the southern regions of the country and of natural gas in central and eastern regions.
We need to focus on two projects.
To construct high voltage lines Ekibastuz – Semey - Ust-Kamenogorsk and Semey – Aktogai – Taldykorgan - Almaty.
This will create a balanced energy supply from Kazakh power plants to all regions of the country.
Fourth, the modernisation of housing and utilities infrastructure and water and heat supply networks.
The total demand for investments makes no less than 2 trillion tenge with annual allocation till 2020 from all sources of founding of no less than 200 billion tenge.
Today we see significant interest in investing in the modernisation of housing and utilities from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and private investors.
We need to ensure their maximum involvement through the provision of long-term investment rates.
Such projects should be co-funded by the state to prevent significant increases in rates.
We should allocate up to 100 billion tenge each year to accelerate the level of modernisation in our heat and water supply systems, in addition to the funds already envisaged in the budget.
Fifth, the strengthening of housing infrastructure.
The formation of urban centres is accompanied by a significant cross-flow of the population.
This creates pressure on the labour market and city infrastructure, including on the housing fund.
Therefore, our approach to construction of rental housing should be revised.
The state will construct social housing to rent out and provide to the population for long term rent with the right to buy it.
The provision of housing directly, without mediators, with low-interest loans will allow us to reduce the cost of acquisition.
No first instalment and low mortgage interest will make housing more affordable for various strata of the people of Kazakhstan.
Therefore, we will additionally increase funding of construction of rental housing for the amount of 180 billion tenge during 2015-2016.
Sixth, development of social infrastructure.
We must resolve the issues of unfit schools and three-shift education, as we set out in our election platform.
The funds envisaged in the 3 year budget do not let us to resolve this problem by 2017.
Therefore, I have ordered the Government to allocate another 70 billion tenge.
Another matter is the lack of kindergartens.
I instruct to allocate an additional 20 billion tenge to reduce the deficit of places in preschools within 3 years.
Akims must deal will this as much as possible and attract the private sector.
Ten higher education institutions were defined within the framework of the industrialisation programme based on which the link between science, economic sectors and personnel training will be ensured.
I have ordered the Government to create the material and technical framework of these education institutions, allocating up to 10 billion tenge by 2017.
Seventh, we need to continue the work to support small and medium businesses and business activities.
As of today, the 100 billion tenge from the National Fund aimed at supporting and crediting small and medium enterprises has been fully used.
This allowed us to create more than 4,500 jobs.
The demand for these funds exceeded the supply by 23 billion tenge.
The unprecedented conditions providing credit for businesses at 6 per cent for 10 years were created.
There were no such conditions in our country before.
We should continue our work to develop small and medium businesses as a driver of economic growth and increase their share to 50 per cent of GDP by 2050.
Therefore, we need to use credit facilities for small and medium businesses more effectively at the account of the ADB, EBRD, and the World Bank for the total amount of 155 billion tenge in 2015-2017.
Dear people of Kazakhstan,
The situation in the world economy makes it sufficiently hard to achieve our goals without extra financial resources.
There was a reason why we established the National Fund.
It was mainly aimed at providing stable social and economic development, and protecting our country’s economy from unpredictable circumstances.
Right now, it is high time to use this fund for our needs.
Kazakhstan should avoid repeating the mistakes of other countries. We have to use our internal resources for economic growth efficiently.
I have made the decision regarding additional allocation of 3 billion US dollars from the National Fund for the period from 2015 to 2017.
I have ordered the Government to prepare respective decisions for the allocation of funds from the National Fund and to take into account the required funds in the draft national budget for 2015 within a week.
The Government should also undertake measures and ensure effective and rational use of these funds.
The commission created by me will strictly monitor the effective use of the funds and report to me personally.
I will request a report about every tenge spent.
Special responsibility is imposed on all the akims.
Nur Otan must actively get involved into this work and to establish strict party control at all levels.
The investments from the National Fund must be accompanied by structural reforms in the economic sectors.
We need to ensure joint implementation of projects with international financial organisations.
For instance, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the EBRD and the IDB are ready to allocate about 9 billion dollars for 90 priority projects.
The allocated funds should support investment activities, prevent a drop in population’s income and stimulate the creation of new jobs.
This will result in sustainable economic growth in the short and medium term.
Our education, health care and agriculture development programmes will continue.
We will have a substantial discussion about this at the first extended meeting of the Government next year.
The New Economic Policy Nurly Zhol is our global step on the path to become one of 30 most developed countries of the world.
All the necessary conditions for successful work have been created.
Administrative reforms were carried out, and the new structure of the Government and executive power is working.
Every minister knows what to do.
We removed redundancy and unnecessary links in management.
Akims have the necessary scope of authority.
The regions have everything – programmes, resources, finances.
Everybody is responsible for their area of work.
They now need to knuckle down and set to work.
The New Economic Policy Nurly Zhol will become a driver of the growth in our economy during the coming years.
200,000 new jobs will be created by the construction of roads alone.
And this means greater employment and growth of income for the population.
Nurly Zhol will create a multiplier effect in other economic sectors: production of cement, metal, machinery, bitumen, equipment and related services.
Roads are lifelines for Kazakhstan.
Life has always emerged and developed in our vast expanses around roads.
We must create such a transport network that car, railway and air lines stretch to all directions from Astana.
Like arteries from the heart.
Like rays from the sun.
The new lines built by the people of Kazakhstan will renew our economy and community.
They will firmly link all the corners of our country with its centre.
Cargo traffic will accelerate and increase.
The volume of transit through the country will grow.
Our citizens will drive on modern and quality highways, and will be able to get to any region quickly and safely.
Social infrastructure will improve, new and modern schools and hospitals will provide high-quality services.
Finally, this will affect the welfare and the quality of life of each citizen of Kazakhstan.
And the main thing is all of this will remain in our land as wealth of our future generations.
Dear people of Kazakhstan,
There is large and important work in front of us.
We must be united to pass this global exam.
We must strengthen trust among all the people of Kazakhstan!
Be tolerant to each other!
These are keys to Kazakhstan’s future.
Interethnic harmony is oxygen.
We never notice it, when we breathe, we do it automatically – we just live.
We must safeguard our unity and our interethnic harmony.
No outsider can come and do this for us.
Our young grow in a new and independent country.
The younger generation did not witness interethnic war or conflict, the devastation of 1990’s.
Many people perceive stability and comfortable life in Kazakhstan as something given since their birth.
For what are stability and harmony?
It is family welfare, safety, a roof over our head.
Peace is the joy of paternity and maternity, health of parents and happiness of our children.
Peace is stable work, wages and feeling confident about the future.
Peace and stability are the achievement of our entire population, which must be protected and reinforced by everyday hard work.
I always say: the young are the foundation of our future.
The state has opened up all the doors and all the paths to the new generation!
Nurly Zhol is where our creative and dynamic young can invest their efforts and develop!
Next year we will solemnly celebrate 20 years since the adoption of the Constitution and the creation of the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan.
When we celebrate these dates, we should make the people of Kazakhstan spiritually stronger, united, and even more tolerant.
I am convinced that our core principle – Kazakhstan, Only Ahead! – will sound in a new way and will acquire a deeper meaning at this new important turn of our history!
I wish success and reaching new heights to all of you, because they will raise our Homeland even higher!
Dear fellow citizens,
We are united by our national idea – Mangilik Yel (Eternal Nation), making its way to the independent development of Nurly Zhol.
To follow this path we need to work hard, and to unite our efforts on the way to a brighter future.
The Eternal Nation is a unifying force and an inexhaustible source of energy.
It is the basis for not only the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy, but also the strong ideological foundation of Kazakhstan’s Statehood in the 21st century!
The Eternal Nation is itself the source of a new Kazakhstan Patriotism.
It is a great principle for the entire society of Kazakhstan.
Adoration for our historical past, pride for today’s fortunes, and faith in our blossoming future – are all covered by the powerful concept of Mangilik Yel (The Eternal Nation).
Love for the fatherland is respect for the great legacy of our ancestors, keeping it as safe as the apple of your eye, making a contribution to its development, and passing it on to future generations.
This is the ultimate goal of all Kazakhstan.
The foundation of the idea of the Eternal Nation runs very deep.
Thirteen centuries ago, the sage Tonykok stated the Eternal Nation is the goal of all Turkic people.
This means that our national idea, just as the roots of our nationhood, originates from our ancient history.
The unity of the people, that’s what makes a viable national idea.
Where there is no unity, and discord flourishes, no national ideas can ever come to life.
Unity and prosperity are the main reasons for the great success achieved by Kazakhstan.
Today, thanks to our respect for stability, we have managed great strides forward.
Humiliating nobody, denying nobody’s language or cultural heritage, while giving all citizens equal opportunities, helps us strengthen the stability of our country.
National unity must be our main treasure to pass on to future generations.
By the presidential decree the powers of deputy of the Senate of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan Baurzhan Alimovich Mukhamedzhanov have been terminated due to his transfer to another job.

We attach great importance to the development of bilateral cooperation.
During the years of independence our countries establish a solid legal base consisting of about more than a hundred documents.
Today we have agreed to carry out an update check of bilateral documents.
We discussed the state and prospects of the Kazakh-Uzbek relations.
We also exchanged views on international and regional issues of mutual interest, the President of Kazakhstan said.

During last year the trade turnover increased by 24 percent, compared to the year of 2010, and amounted to US $2 billion.
For the first half of the current year, it has grown by more than 8 percent and reached almost US $1 billion.
We are aimed at further increase of trade turnover and will make joint efforts for expansion of the list of products.
We have significant potential for the development of cooperation in investment, transport, communications, agricultural, cultural-humanitarian and other spheres.
Discussion of the mechanism of joint usage of water-energy resources of the Central-Asian region and promotion of activity of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea has become an important topic of the negotiations.
We also discussed the prospects of cooperation in transport and transit sphere.
Together we can make our region an important transit bridge between Europe and Asia, the President of Kazakhstan said.
Nursultan Nazarbayev also pointed out that in the course of negotiations the sides discussed topical issues of the regional agenda, as well as interaction within international organizations.
In particular, we exchanged views on the situation in Afghanistan and in the Middle East.
Security and stability of Central Asia largely depend on our mutual efforts.
And we intend to expand cooperation in the field of combating transnational threats and challenges, as under the framework of multilateral organizations, as well as at the bilateral level.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the mutual intention to deepen strategic partnership for the benefit of the peoples of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, Nursultan Nazarbayev highlighted.
In his speech the President of Uzbekistan thanked the Kazakh side for the warm welcome and the successful negotiations.
First of all, I would like to express my great satisfaction with the stay of our delegation in Kazakhstan and with fruitful talks with the President of Kazakhstan.
For a long time we had not such a frank discussion on almost all areas of interest for us.
I really needed such a friendly meeting and substantive conversation.
Together we discussed and assessed the difficult situation in the region and possible negative consequences of the world financial crisis for our countries.
And I have to say that we have reached a mutual agreement on all issues of interest, reaffirmed our common approaches and aspiration to joint settlement of tasks we are challenged with.
I consider it is the main result of our bilateral meeting and extended talks of the delegations.
Moreover, we expressed mutual aspiration for the coordination of our countries within international and regional organizations, which will be facilitated by the joint program of our foreign policy ministries, the President of Uzbekistan said.
Islam Karimov emphasized the high level of trade turnover between our countries, and agreed with Nursultan Nazarbayev in the fact that there are all conditions and reasons for its significant growth in the coming years.
We agreed that the trade turnover does not fully meet the potential of our economies and there is need to further strengthen trade and economic cooperation.
One of the most important conditions for the development of economic interaction between the countries is the agreement in the transport and communications sphere.
Another key topic of our discussions was the rational use of water-energy resources of our region.
A thorough, collaborative and comprehensive approach from all the countries of the region needs to settle this problem.
We also reached the agreement on further cooperation in cultural-humanitarian sphere, which is the most important factor of rapprochement of our peoples that contributes to the strengthening of interethnic consent.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that the visit to Kazakhstan is aimed to confirm the historical, cultural and spiritual closeness of the Uzbek and Kazakh peoples, the common interests and continuity of the destinies of our countries.
These values will continue to be the basis of the relations and cooperation between our countries, the President of Uzbekistan added.

Nursultan Nazarbayev Says: Kazakhstan’s Economy Has a Very High Margin of Safety, We Do Not Have Any Crisis Trends
Events
President Nursultan Nazarbayev said that at a meeting with Cabinet Ministers, and considered results of social and economic development in the country over the last nine months and set a number of goals for the nearest future.
Prime Minister Karim Masimov delivered a speech at the council and noted that high rates of economic growth were observed during the nine months of this year.
As the Agency for statistics says, the Gross Domestic Product has increased by 10.2% over the eight months of 2007 in comparison with the same figure of the last year.
The economy growth is due to production increase in all major sectors.
Investments in fixed capital have increased by more than 10% in comparison with the same figure of the last year.
The volume of foreign trade has increased by 31%.
The population’s active incomes have increased by almost 13%, and real salaries have increased by 20% over the eight months of the current year in comparison with the same figures of the last year.
State budget funds correspond to expectations and are equal to 1.8 trillion tenges.
About 10% of population participated in the action for property legalization that was finished on the 1st of August this year. The value of the legalized assets is almost 850 billion tenges.
The state budget received 60 billion tenges of taxes for the legalized properties.
The inflation rate was averaged at 8.6% over the nine months of 2007.
In connection with that the Government together with regions’ governors developed a complex of measures on offering additional addressed assistance to the people.
A project of the State Program 30 corporative leaders has been developed and is going to be considered by the President in the nearest future.
Karim Masimov underscored that the Government plans to develop a strategy for sustainable growth of the economy’s competitiveness in the nearest future.
An emphasis will be put on the development of electricity production, railroad and automobile transport, telecommunications and communications in order to ensure a long-term sustainable growth in the economy.
Chairman of the National Bank of Kazakhstan Anvar Saidenov described the situation in the country’s financial market and noted that major factors allow reducing the inflation rate in the beginning of the next year.
While talking about loans of Kazakhstani banks abroad, the net volume of which was at 23.6 billion dollars last September (the banks have assets abroad costing some 21 billion dollars), Anvar Saidenov underscored that banks could manage their obligations themselves at the expense of their own means.
Kazakhstani banks have 3.8 billion dollars of debt abroad that has to be paid by the end of this year.
Currently, the National Bank supports the country’s banking sector in two ways.
Those are borrowing assets for a short-term at 9% of annual interest for some types of transactions and giving a dispensation to reduce minimal reserve requirements from 9 October that releases some 300 billion tenges.
That is a large enough sum that must be used for paying external debts and sustaining credit activities.
There is no need now to spend money from the National Fund, the National Bank’s Chairman emphasized.
Arman Dunaev, Chairman of the Agency for regulating and controlling financial organizations agrees with him.
Today, all secondary banks discharge all their liabilities in full in the face of both residents and non-residents and without any delay.
The local banks can resolve all the problems of refinancing at their own expenses, and there are all preconditions to believe that in a short-term period the country’s banking system will adequately react to all external challenges in the situation that is observed in global markets, Arman Dunaev underscored.
He also emphasized that the loan share allocated by Kazakhstani banks to mortgages is not critical in relation to the total amount, and the quality of the loan portfolio is at an acceptable level.
Agriculture Minister Akhmetzhan Esimov remarked on the measures that are being taken in order to regulate grain and flour supplies and also bread prices.
Akhmetzhan Esimov said stabilization funds have been established in all regions of the country and the problem of grain and flour supply was solved including those regions not having own grain production.
At the same time, we enforced control over prices and they will not grow until the end of this year, the Agriculture Minister said.
Bakhytzhan Sagintaev, Chairman of the Agency for regulating natural monopolies put an emphasis on the problem of energy-saving.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev assessed the current situation in the economy.
Kazakhstan’s economy has a very high margin of safety and we do not have any crisis trends.
Our banks are stable.
They are managing the situation themselves, and if difficulties occur the state will support the banks.
We have got all possibilities to do that, and our people must be confident in that.
The state will discharge its obligations both internal and abroad.
President set a number of concrete tasks for the Government.
First, it is state regulation of inflation processes, conduction of price, tariff and social policies aimed at increasing the prosperity of Kazakhstani people.
Prices for food will not grow.
the Government has taken measures to prevent it.
The competition issue is very important in this matter.
Second-hand dealers have monopolized the market; this is the main reason of the price growth.
Therefore, we are establishing a special Agency for fair competition.
The Head of State noted that local powers prevented bread price growth in the Southern Kazakhstan, Kostanay and Northern Kazakhstan regions.
I am addressing all governors of regions, cities and districts: it is your responsibility to work this problem out.
This is the main issue now.
Governors must take control over all processes on reducing and stabilizing food prices.
The active work of the financial police, Committee for fair competition and law-enforcement organs is also required in this case, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
At the same time, the President instructed the Government to take effective measures to protect socially vulnerable population strata.
In 2007, extra revenues of local budgets are valued at more than 36 billion tenges.
These revenues must be spent on supporting socially vulnerable population strata, many-children families, pensioners that depend on bread prices in a greater degree than others.
This support must be addressed, and expenditure process must be strictly controlled, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
A second task set by the country’s President for the Government, National Bank and AFC is an effective conduction of explanatory work on those processes that are taking place in our economy.
As the Head of State noted, unverified information in the media, lack of explanatory work amongst foreign investors, analytics of large foreign banks, financial institutes leads to the deficiency of actual information on the condition of the country’s economy in international rating agencies and consequently to unreasoned decrease in the country’s rankings.
A third task that the President has emphasized for the Government is ensuring stability in the financial system.
You have reported on the measures that are being taken.
On the whole, I approve them.
The situation in the financial market does not cause serious anxiety.
Obviously, the situation in the global financial markets enforced native banks to revise their loan strategies.
As a whole, it will be good for the banks themselves, the Head of State said.
At the same time, the President noted it is necessary to take preventive measures that will allow avoiding difficult situations in the banking system.
I instruct and warn the Government, National Bank, development institutes and the AFC that they must allocate 4 billion dollars from the budget in 2008 in order to financially support, if a need arises, the banking sector.
All shareholders that invested in housing construction, small and medium-size business and also enterprises working in the framework of the Strategy for industrial innovative development must be protected, Nursultan Nazarbayev underscored.
The fourth task is the perfection of tariff policy in electricity industry and energy-saving.
The President instructed to hold a popular explanatory work on the necessity of energy- and water-saving.
It is a known fact that a GDP unit requires 3-4 times greater energy in Kazakhstan than in industrially developed countries.
Low tariffs are the main cause of the branch’s lag and low investment attractiveness, they do not stimulate introduction of energy-saving technologies and equipment renewal.
The President remarked that in his opinion it is necessary to develop an integrated state program that will administrate and stimulate energy-saving technologies, and also will improve the relevant legislation basis.

Addresses of the President of Kazakhstan
Nyrly Zhol – The Path to the Future
Dear people of Kazakhstan,
The world is facing new challenges and threats today.
The world economy has still not recovered from consequences of the global financial and economic crisis.
The recovery continues at a very slow and uncertain pace, and some countries remain in decline.
The geopolitical crisis and the sanctions policy of the leading powers create an additional obstacle for the recovery of the world economy.
From my experience, I feel that the years to come will become the time of global trials.
The entire architecture of the world will be changing.
Not all countries will be able to get through these complications in a decent manner.
Only strong states, with their people united, will manage to do that.
Kazakhstan, as a part of the world economy and a country located very close to the epicentre of geopolitical tensions, is experiencing negative pressure from all these challenges.
We see the results: prices in global markets are dropping, and general economic growth is slowing down.
As is known, the forecasts of the development of the global economy for 2014 and the next two years were revised downward by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
That means we need to revise our own plans, and make adjustments for the coming period.
There is no time for hesitation.
The measures I will talk about today will be implemented from January 1, 2015.
We must promptly take all the possible measures to prevent negative trends.
Today the Government is already working quickly at my order.
We have revised the parameters of the republic’s budget for 2015.
And this is right, as the drop in prices of our export raw materials has led to the reduction of the flow of money to our income.
At the same time, the Government have a tough yet specific task: it must fulfil all social liabilities in full.
In a crisis, as we’re seeing the world over, economic policies must be re-evaluated.
The sectors that need support are those which create the highest multiplier effect on economic growth and employment.
We have already had such an experience.
Suffice it to recall our successful anti-crisis measures in 2007-2009.
As you see, life makes adjustments to the best laid plans.
And we should add new content to the platform of our party based on today’s reality.
On my orders, the Government has completed the development of a new large-scale development programme.
Today, as we respond to the challenges we face, I proclaim Kazakhstan’s New Economic Policy Nyrly Zhol (The Bright Road).
This is what I devote my state-of-the-nation address for 2015.
The policy will have a counter-cyclical character and will be aimed at continuing structural reforms in our economy.
What does this mean?
Over the years, when the situation in external markets was favourable, and the price of oil and our export products were at sufficiently high level, we diverted revenues from those exports to the National Fund.
One of the main tasks of the National Fund is to increase resistance of our economy to external shocks, including when prices of natural resources drop.
We were putting income from extraction and sales of raw materials into this Fund during all these years.
We used 10 billion US dollars out of the National Fund to fight the crisis of 2007-2009.
As for the rest of the money, we have not spent it.
We saved and multiplied it.
Now we are in the period when we must use these reserves.
They will help overcome uneasy times and stimulate the growth of our economy.
These resources are not intended for short-term measures.
namely – the development of transport, energy, industrial and social infrastructure, and small and medium businesses.
We will spend them on the transformation of our economy.
In February, a decision was made to allocate one trillion tenge from the National Fund to support economic growth and employment in 2014-2015 in two tranches of 500 billion tenge.
To finalise the initiated projects and resolve pressing issues, I have instructed the Government to divert the second tranche of 500 billion tenge from the National Fund to the following goals:
First, 100 billion tenge should be additionally allocated to issue easy-term loans to small and medium businesses, as well as large enterprises.
This will secure the implementation of projects in the food and chemical industries, engineering, as well as the service sector.
Second, to revive the banking sector and buy out bad loans, I have ordered additional capitalisation of the Fund of Problem Loans in the amount of 250 billion tenge in 2015.
Third, to raise new investments, we need to improve respective conditions.
For these purposes, I have ordered the government to allocate 81 billion tenge in 2015 to complete the construction of the dry port complex, the infrastructure of the special economic zones at Khorgos – East Gate and the National Industrial Petrochemical Technological Park in Atyrau and Taraz.
Fourth, to continue the construction of the EXPO-2017, I have ordered the allocation of 40 billion tenge in 2015 adding to the already allocated 25 billion tenge.
Fifth, on the eve of EXPO-2017, we need to take care of the development of Astana’s transport infrastructure.
This year the capital airport will reach its maximum capacity – 3.5 million people.
Therefore, to increase its potential, I have ordered the allocation in 2015 of 29 billion tenge on the construction of a new terminal and a reconstruction of the landing strip.
This will allow us to increase airport capacity to 7.1 million of passengers per year by 2017.
Dear people of Kazakhstan,
In view of new external risks for the development of our economy, we need new initiatives to stimulate business activity and employment.
The Infrastructure Development Plan, which I want to make public today, will become the core of the New Economic Policy.
It is intended to last for five years and is to run in parallel with the Second Five Year term of the Programme of Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development. More than 100 foreign companies intend to participate in its implementation.
The total investment portfolio will make 6 trillion tenge, with the state contributing 15 per cent of the total.
Kazakhstan owns a territory so vast it would tire the wings of a bird to fly over it.
Thus, this plan requires huge funds and hard work.
There is a saying: If you want to know a nation’s prosperity look at its paths.
Road connections are of high importance, not only for travel, but also for the transportation of goods.
In ancient times our big cities were located along the Great Silk Road.
Nowadays, all essential life depends on access to the main highways.
Roads are the essence of life, the source of a modern existence.
All the regions of Kazakhstan need to be closely connected by railroads, highways, and air services.
The nine roads, connecting with each other in Astana are like the roots of life, spread our capital’s creative spirit.
Improving interconnectivity between the regions will eventually lead to a greater domestic well-being.
It will strengthen trade and economic ties between the regions.
There will be new markets emerging from inside the country.
Therefore bringing together distant parts is the main focus of today’s address.
First, the development of transport and logistics infrastructure will be formed around regional hubs, connected through Astana as the central hub and backbone by highways, railways and airlines.
But first, we need to implement the main road projects.
They are Western China to Western Europe; Astana to Almaty; Astana to Ust-Kamenogorsk; Astana to Aktobe to Atyrau; Almay to Ust-Kamenogorsk; Karaganda to Zhezkazgan to Kyzylorda; Atyrau to Astrakhan.
It is also necessary to continue the creation of a logistical hub in the east and marine infrastructure in the west of the country.
The large-scale ferry site from Kuryk and the railway line from Borzhakty to Yersai will contribute to the growth of exports to the west through ports in the Caspian Sea.
I have ordered the Government to work on the construction or rental of terminals at dry and sea ports in China, Iran, Russia and the EU.
Second, development of industrial infrastructure.
The implementation of infrastructure projects will produce big demand for construction materials, products and services for transport, communication, energy, housing and utility areas.
So, firstly, we need to complete our work on the formation of infrastructure in existing special economic zones.
The Government and the akims (governors) need to work in a timely manner to fill those zones with concrete projects.
Secondly, they need to explore the possibility of constructing new industrial zones in regions aimed at the development of production facilities of SMEs and raising extra investments.
Tourism infrastructure is a separate line.
Its main advantage is the opportunity to create jobs.
The creation of one job here costs 10 times less than in industry.
Third, the development of energy infrastructure.
Extensive work has been carried out within the framework of the industrialisation programme in energy in the past five years.
Nevertheless, limited transmission systems create a deficit of electric energy in the southern regions of the country and of natural gas in central and eastern regions.
We need to focus on two projects.
To construct high voltage lines Ekibastuz – Semey - Ust-Kamenogorsk and Semey – Aktogai – Taldykorgan - Almaty.
This will create a balanced energy supply from Kazakh power plants to all regions of the country.
Fourth, the modernisation of housing and utilities infrastructure and water and heat supply networks.
The total demand for investments makes no less than 2 trillion tenge with annual allocation till 2020 from all sources of founding of no less than 200 billion tenge.
Today we see significant interest in investing in the modernisation of housing and utilities from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and private investors.
We need to ensure their maximum involvement through the provision of long-term investment rates.
Such projects should be co-funded by the state to prevent significant increases in rates.
We should allocate up to 100 billion tenge each year to accelerate the level of modernisation in our heat and water supply systems, in addition to the funds already envisaged in the budget.
Fifth, the strengthening of housing infrastructure.
The formation of urban centres is accompanied by a significant cross-flow of the population.
This creates pressure on the labour market and city infrastructure, including on the housing fund.
Therefore, our approach to construction of rental housing should be revised.
The state will construct social housing to rent out and provide to the population for long term rent with the right to buy it.
The provision of housing directly, without mediators, with low-interest loans will allow us to reduce the cost of acquisition.
No first instalment and low mortgage interest will make housing more affordable for various strata of the people of Kazakhstan.
Therefore, we will additionally increase funding of construction of rental housing for the amount of 180 billion tenge during 2015-2016.
Sixth, development of social infrastructure.
We must resolve the issues of unfit schools and three-shift education, as we set out in our election platform.
The funds envisaged in the 3 year budget do not let us to resolve this problem by 2017.
Therefore, I have ordered the Government to allocate another 70 billion tenge.
Another matter is the lack of kindergartens.
I instruct to allocate an additional 20 billion tenge to reduce the deficit of places in preschools within 3 years.
Akims must deal will this as much as possible and attract the private sector.
Ten higher education institutions were defined within the framework of the industrialisation programme based on which the link between science, economic sectors and personnel training will be ensured.
I have ordered the Government to create the material and technical framework of these education institutions, allocating up to 10 billion tenge by 2017.
Seventh, we need to continue the work to support small and medium businesses and business activities.
As of today, the 100 billion tenge from the National Fund aimed at supporting and crediting small and medium enterprises has been fully used.
This allowed us to create more than 4,500 jobs.
The demand for these funds exceeded the supply by 23 billion tenge.
The unprecedented conditions providing credit for businesses at 6 per cent for 10 years were created.
There were no such conditions in our country before.
We should continue our work to develop small and medium businesses as a driver of economic growth and increase their share to 50 per cent of GDP by 2050.
Therefore, we need to use credit facilities for small and medium businesses more effectively at the account of the ADB, EBRD, and the World Bank for the total amount of 155 billion tenge in 2015-2017.
Dear people of Kazakhstan,
The situation in the world economy makes it sufficiently hard to achieve our goals without extra financial resources.
There was a reason why we established the National Fund.
It was mainly aimed at providing stable social and economic development, and protecting our country’s economy from unpredictable circumstances.
Right now, it is high time to use this fund for our needs.
Kazakhstan should avoid repeating the mistakes of other countries. We have to use our internal resources for economic growth efficiently.
I have made the decision regarding additional allocation of 3 billion US dollars from the National Fund for the period from 2015 to 2017.
I have ordered the Government to prepare respective decisions for the allocation of funds from the National Fund and to take into account the required funds in the draft national budget for 2015 within a week.
The Government should also undertake measures and ensure effective and rational use of these funds.
The commission created by me will strictly monitor the effective use of the funds and report to me personally.
I will request a report about every tenge spent.
Special responsibility is imposed on all the akims.
Nur Otan must actively get involved into this work and to establish strict party control at all levels.
The investments from the National Fund must be accompanied by structural reforms in the economic sectors.
We need to ensure joint implementation of projects with international financial organisations.
For instance, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the EBRD and the IDB are ready to allocate about 9 billion dollars for 90 priority projects.
The allocated funds should support investment activities, prevent a drop in population’s income and stimulate the creation of new jobs.
This will result in sustainable economic growth in the short and medium term.
Our education, health care and agriculture development programmes will continue.
We will have a substantial discussion about this at the first extended meeting of the Government next year.
The New Economic Policy Nurly Zhol is our global step on the path to become one of 30 most developed countries of the world.
All the necessary conditions for successful work have been created.
Administrative reforms were carried out, and the new structure of the Government and executive power is working.
Every minister knows what to do.
We removed redundancy and unnecessary links in management.
Akims have the necessary scope of authority.
The regions have everything – programmes, resources, finances.
Everybody is responsible for their area of work.
They now need to knuckle down and set to work.
The New Economic Policy Nurly Zhol will become a driver of the growth in our economy during the coming years.
200,000 new jobs will be created by the construction of roads alone.
And this means greater employment and growth of income for the population.
Nurly Zhol will create a multiplier effect in other economic sectors: production of cement, metal, machinery, bitumen, equipment and related services.
Roads are lifelines for Kazakhstan.
Life has always emerged and developed in our vast expanses around roads.
We must create such a transport network that car, railway and air lines stretch to all directions from Astana.
Like arteries from the heart.
Like rays from the sun.
The new lines built by the people of Kazakhstan will renew our economy and community.
They will firmly link all the corners of our country with its centre.
Cargo traffic will accelerate and increase.
The volume of transit through the country will grow.
Our citizens will drive on modern and quality highways, and will be able to get to any region quickly and safely.
Social infrastructure will improve, new and modern schools and hospitals will provide high-quality services.
Finally, this will affect the welfare and the quality of life of each citizen of Kazakhstan.
And the main thing is all of this will remain in our land as wealth of our future generations.
Dear people of Kazakhstan,
There is large and important work in front of us.
We must be united to pass this global exam.
We must strengthen trust among all the people of Kazakhstan!
Be tolerant to each other!
These are keys to Kazakhstan’s future.
Interethnic harmony is oxygen.
We never notice it, when we breathe, we do it automatically – we just live.
We must safeguard our unity and our interethnic harmony.
No outsider can come and do this for us.
Our young grow in a new and independent country.
The younger generation did not witness interethnic war or conflict, the devastation of 1990’s.
Many people perceive stability and comfortable life in Kazakhstan as something given since their birth.
For what are stability and harmony?
It is family welfare, safety, a roof over our head.
Peace is the joy of paternity and maternity, health of parents and happiness of our children.
Peace is stable work, wages and feeling confident about the future.
Peace and stability are the achievement of our entire population, which must be protected and reinforced by everyday hard work.
I always say: the young are the foundation of our future.
The state has opened up all the doors and all the paths to the new generation!
Nurly Zhol is where our creative and dynamic young can invest their efforts and develop!
Next year we will solemnly celebrate 20 years since the adoption of the Constitution and the creation of the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan.
When we celebrate these dates, we should make the people of Kazakhstan spiritually stronger, united, and even more tolerant.
I am convinced that our core principle – Kazakhstan, Only Ahead! – will sound in a new way and will acquire a deeper meaning at this new important turn of our history!
I wish success and reaching new heights to all of you, because they will raise our Homeland even higher!
Dear fellow citizens,
We are united by our national idea – Mangilik Yel (Eternal Nation), making its way to the independent development of Nurly Zhol.
To follow this path we need to work hard, and to unite our efforts on the way to a brighter future.
The Eternal Nation is a unifying force and an inexhaustible source of energy.
It is the basis for not only the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy, but also the strong ideological foundation of Kazakhstan’s Statehood in the 21st century!
The Eternal Nation is itself the source of a new Kazakhstan Patriotism.
It is a great principle for the entire society of Kazakhstan.
Adoration for our historical past, pride for today’s fortunes, and faith in our blossoming future – are all covered by the powerful concept of Mangilik Yel (The Eternal Nation).
Love for the fatherland is respect for the great legacy of our ancestors, keeping it as safe as the apple of your eye, making a contribution to its development, and passing it on to future generations.
This is the ultimate goal of all Kazakhstan.
The foundation of the idea of the Eternal Nation runs very deep.
Thirteen centuries ago, the sage Tonykok stated the Eternal Nation is the goal of all Turkic people.
This means that our national idea, just as the roots of our nationhood, originates from our ancient history.
The unity of the people, that’s what makes a viable national idea.
Where there is no unity, and discord flourishes, no national ideas can ever come to life.
Unity and prosperity are the main reasons for the great success achieved by Kazakhstan.
Today, thanks to our respect for stability, we have managed great strides forward.
Humiliating nobody, denying nobody’s language or cultural heritage, while giving all citizens equal opportunities, helps us strengthen the stability of our country.
National unity must be our main treasure to pass on to future generations.

By orders of the President:
Events
The political reforms offered by President Nursultan Nazarbayev and the adoption of constitutional amendments by Kazakhstan’s Parliament are in the focus of international mass media worldwide.
Events
The constitutional reform has caused positive responses from abroad and is considered as the next very important stage in the democratization of Kazakhstan.
The American International Herald Tribunewrites that key changes in the political system of Kazakhstan must be the reduction of the presidential term and the increase of the powers of parliament.
Summarizing this event, they emphasize Nazarbayev has brought prosperity to the 15 million population with market reforms and Western investment in the country's vast energy sector.
Radio Free Europe headlines its material Kazakh President Stumps for Evolutionary Changes and conducts a detailed analysis of all major amendments including those which imply shortening the presidential term, strengthening the powers of parliament, increasing the number of deputies, state financing of public associations and parties.
The author also cites Zharmakhan Tuyakbay, one of the leaders of Kazakh opposition, who expressed optimism saying authorities apparently intend to implement serious political reforms.
Many of Russian mass media covered Nursultan Nazarbayev’s speech in the Parliament in their news blocks and materials.
News agencies and television channels covered the event and gave analytical comments.
NTV says the President of Kazakhstan has announced the radical transformation and democratization of state power.
It is not everyday that a form of government is changed in the post Soviet countries.
It is very seldom that this occurs without a corresponding revolution of one color or another and rallies in front of parliament.
Nursultan Nazarbayev has demonstrated a new type of revolution. It is a revolution from the top.
Russia and First television channels called the statements of Kazakhstan’s President a sensation because they lead to the change of the republic’s form of government and significant increase of the powers of parliament.
Their evaluations were as following:
Kazakhstan changes its political system
Having completed the economic modernization of the country, Nursultan Nazarbayev works on the development of democracy
Hitherto, none of political leaders in the region has suggested such reforms
Kazakhstan follows the way of transforming political system
Patriarch of politics Nursultan Nazarbayev realizes that great presidential powers require skill and time. This is hard work and everyday self-control.
Positive evaluations of print and Internet media are seen in the following headlines of their materials: Kazakhstan’s Leader Shares His Power, Nazarbayev Thinks about Future, Nazarbayev Changes Kazakhstan’s Face, Kazakhstan Begins Massive Political Reform, Kazakhstan Transforms Its Executive Power, and Kazakhstan Will Resemble France.
The Rossiyskaia Gazeta newspaper comments that proposed bill with the utmost clarity outlines a full reformation of the political system, which aimed at keeping political stability in the country.
The Gazeta newspaper from Moscow in its article People of the Steppes – Culture Trend Makers states that Kazakhstan has surpassed Russia both in economic and now, in political development… Kazakhstan’s phenomenon deserves to be appreciated.
The main thing is that regardless of political characteristics given to him Nursultan Nazarbayev has proved Deng Xiaoping’s theorem in Kazakhstan.
He has proved he is an effective politician
more effective than both Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin.
In Russia, European democratic values once accepted, now are proclaimed to be a form of dictatorship.
Kazakhstan is moving in an opposite direction.
The Vedomosti newspaper links the beginning of the large scale political reform to the necessity of establishing an effective system ensuring legitimate power transfer.
One way or another, we are witnessing different approaches to the problem of power transfer.
Kazakhstan plans its own in advance trying to avoid negative scenarios with the help of institutional transformation.
Political struggle in Russia with the external manifestation of preserving commonly adopted democratic norms tends to further transform into the clan struggle featured in Byzantium and east despotisms.
Nezavisimaia Gazeta, Novie Izvestia and Novosti Russia newspapers cite leaders of opposition parties Zharmakhan Tuyakbay and Alikhan Baimenov who positively estimated the forthcoming reform.
The Trud newspaper called the President of Kazakhstan a patriarch of politics in the post Soviet countries and emphasized Nazarbayev has shaped his rational suggestions into the form of amendments to Constitution and characterized them as fundamental.
In addition, Russian mass media published numerous comments and opinions of political scientists and experts: Arkadiy Dubnov, political scientist: Indeed, Nazarbayev is an outstanding leader in the post Soviet countries.
He has always adhered to the policy of conducting first economic, and then political reforms.
Sergey Markov, director of the Institute for Political Researches: Kazakhstan changes the Asian way of development for the East European.
In the last 15 years, Nazarbayev conducted very successful modernization in Kazakhstan.
He has raised the standards of life, ensured political stability and increased rates of economic growth.
On this basis, he started gradual democratization of political system.
I am sure, this will be done in Nazarbayev’ way, e.g. gradually, steadily and with positive outcomes.
Alexander Kniazev, political scientist: Processes in Kazakhstan resemble the evolution of China.
Over several decades economy is reformed under an authoritarian strict political system in the first instance, and then having achieved some results, one reforms political system.
Nursultan Nazarbayev’s initiatives are a signal to political leaders to act.
Politicians have enough time because the President will perform his duties until the end of his term in 2012.
It is possible to earn political capital and reputation by that time.
Alexander Vlasov, political scientist: Proposals of President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan on political transformations in the country are an evidence of the transfer of authorities from words to real political reforms.
The political community of the country has positively accepted announced changes and, first of all, strengthening the role of political parties.
It is difficult to distinguish any key proposal from the set put forward by Nazarbayev because they form an integrated complex of measures on democratization in the country.
Akhmed Bilalov, deputy chairman of the Committee for CIS affairs and relations with compatriots of the State Duma:
It is possible to consider suggested amendments to the Constitution as movement toward a national compromise.
The initiative to elect some of deputies to the Parliament by the approval of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan is a good example of that.
In the end, the reform must assist the stability and sustainability of Kazakhstan’s society.

Secondly, as I have already spoken I am not going to make any special election campaign, because I think my publicity campaign is what I have done during all these years and Kazakhstani people know about it.
As for the next seven years I have clearly said about it in my speeches this year, especially on September 1 on the opening of our Parliament's session.
Thirdly, according to our election legislation the election should be equal to all candidates giving them equal opportunities.
The law is one for all.
All candidates including that from opposition must observe the Law on elections, the Constitution and other laws of our country.
Such approach will secure one more historically important stage of our development when competiton, propaganda, PR-campaign will be run in a civilized way not breaking the Constitution and the laws.
We have to lay the foundations of such approach.
And finally, I have already said anmd want to say it again that according to the clauses of the Decree law-enforcement authorities are to strictly observe the execution of our legislation by the candidates and their proxies.
It also concerns non-governmental Kazakhstani and international organizations.
We won’t permit interference in the domestic affairs of the country by the way of financing of political parties and public organizations or by rendering support to one or another candidate because it is prohibited by the Constitution and the laws of our country.
I call the attention of all kazakhstani people to seriuosly regard of this historic moment.
Preservation of political stability, public order in our country and international accord is a key to our success in the future.

President Nursultan Nazarbayev Meets with Foreign Diplomatic Corps Accredited to the Republic of Kazakhstan
Events
I am pleased to meet all of you on the eve of the 16th anniversary of independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
This year, we celebrate not only the 16th anniversary of the sovereign development of our country, but also a jubilee of our capital city.
Today is the 10th anniversary of announcing Akmola the capital of Kazakhstan, the President said at the opening of the meeting.
At present time, about 40 of 53 diplomatic missions have already moved to the capital.
This year, eight missions transferred their offices to the capital.
In his speech addressed to the diplomatic corps, the President outlined the main priorities of Kazakhstan’s development.
Liberalization in the economy and further steps toward democracy in the Kazakhstani society were and must be major trends in the development of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev underscored.
The development of not-extracting industries and economy diversification, involvement of our country to world economic relations are crucial priorities of the country’s economic modernization.
It is important to the republic to promote the Kazakhstani brand in all directions: to West and East, to North and South.
This is especially important in relation to the neighboring markets of Russia, China, Central Asia, Caspian and Black Sea regions, the Head of State noted.
Joint projects in the areas of energy, transport and space engineering are of great importance in Kazakhstan-Russia relations.
The trade turnover between the two countries is equal to 16 billion dollars; this is greater by 25% than in the last year.
The task to increase trade turnover with China up to 10 billion dollars by 2010 will be implemented next year.
There is a trend to interact not only in the area of energy, but also in not-extracting sectors of economy.
Border trade and investment cooperation are being actively developed.
Kazakhstan is interested in the social economic well-being of states in Central Asia and ready to participate in the implementation of large investment projects.
Taking into account the fact that the economies of states in the Caspian and Black Sea basins are being dynamically developed, Kazakhstan offers to unite efforts of the two regions in order to ensure the economic prosperity of whole Eurasia.
Our country is also interested to continue its active participation in the process of economic integration in the framework of the SCO and EurAsEC.
Special emphasis is put on cooperation with international financial institutions and development banks, on accession to the WTO.
The President underscored that Kazakhstan strives to join the WTO on terms of mutual benefit and corresponding to the strategic and economic interests of our country.
So far, bilateral negotiations have been completed in relation to many countries.
In this regard, the President expressed his gratitude for the constructive approach to and support of Kazakhstan’s accession to this international organization offered by the governments of these countries and also addressed Heads of the diplomatic missions of the United States, European Commission, Australia, Republic of Mongolia and India.
Considering the high level of economic and trade relations between our countries, I hope your governments will offer their support to Kazakhstan’s intention to join the WTO and will finish bilateral negotiations early next year, the President said.
The Head of State noted Kazakhstan’s economic possibilities assist to further political modernization in the society.
New constitutional reform conducted this year offers an optimal transformation of the post-Soviet system from the presidential to the presidential-parliamentary one.
At the same time, conducted constitutional amendments do not mean the completion of democratic transformations, the President underscored.
The President put an emphasis on the invariance of Kazakhstan’s priorities in foreign policy.
Our country was and is an active member of the broad international cooperation aimed at nuclear non-proliferation, fight against international terror, religious extremisms and other modern threats.
Kazakhstan intends to further strengthen good-neighbor and promising relations with Russia and China, strategic partnership with the United States and European Union.
Interaction with countries of Central Asia is one of the most important priorities.
Relationships with countries of the Middle East, Persian Gulf Asia-Pacific and Latin America have great potential and tremendous prospects especially in the economic area.
Kazakhstan places a strong emphasis in its interaction with the United Nations and is ready to assist in promotion of the Organization’s goals and principles.
The President called the membership of our country in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia that promotes security and social economic cooperation throughout the Asian continent to be among top priorities.
This is a milestone event not only to our country, but also to the OSCE, which experiences now the difficult period of renovation and improvement of its work.
As the OSCE Chair-in-Office, we intend to contribute to the strengthening of the Organization’s authority and reputation, which offers a unique opportunity for dialogue between North Atlantic and Eurasian countries, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized and thanked all OSCE member countries for the support offered.
The President said Kazakhstan, as the OSCE Chairman, will do its best in order to strengthen mutual respect between countries, and will observe for compliance with major principles and standards of the OSCE.
Our consistent policy aimed at ensuring tolerance, inter-confessional and inter-cultural accord between representatives of all nations residing in Kazakhstan has received international recognition.
The Assembly of the people of Kazakhstan that has obtained constitutional status serves this goal.
This is very useful experience we would like to share with OSCE member countries.
Kazakhstan plays an important role in maintaining dialogue between civilizations and confessions in the framework of the Congress of world and traditional religions.
As you know, at the 62nd UN General Assembly, I offered to hold the third Congress in Astana in 2009 under the aegis of the UN.
I believe that if all countries interested in maintaining and deepening dialogue between civilizations make joint efforts on that, we will make a significant step toward understanding between East and West on key problems of modern reality, the Head of State said.
At the end of the meeting, the President thanked representatives of the diplomatic corps for the constructive work on developing cooperation with Kazakhstan and congratulated on the forthcoming holiday.
We very high appreciate kind relations with the diplomatic corps and thankful to you for the warm and sincere feelings to our people.

President Responds to a Message from the Hiroshima Youth Committee of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons
press conferences and correspondence
In their letter to the President, authors noted that 67 years ago, a nuclear bomb destroyed their city and instantly killed tens of thousands of innocent people.
As youth of Hiroshima, we are deeply concerned that our future is still being threatened by close to 20,000 nuclear weapons.
We are writing to you and other leaders to ask for help in eliminating this threat.
We enclose a gift of 1,000 hand-folded paper cranes – each one a prayer for a peaceful, nuclear- weapon-free world, says the letter.
The authors told about plans to publish the address of the Head of State as part of their campaign to inspire people around the world to work towards a global ban on nuclear testing.
We fear that unless governments and individuals do more to rid the world of these horrible weapons, another city might one day suffer the same fate as our own.
As youth peace ambassadors, we feel that we must do everything in our power to keep that from happening – which is why we are seeking your support, the letter noted.
In his own letter in response, the President of Kazakhstan underlined that August 6, 1945 forever went down in history as the day of the tragedy of the Japanese people which suffered from the nuclear bombings.
The people of Kazakhstan, as well as the people of Japan which are close to us, have experienced the horrors of nuclear weapons and as no one else know about the terrible consequences of nuclear testing.
Twenty-onw years have passed since I signed the decree to shut down the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site.
This historic act committed according to the will of people of our country, has a huge civilizational value.
Kazakhstan has bridged its nuclear fears and also relieved from these fears those to whom they have been indoctrinated with our nuclear arsenal, the letter said.
The Head of State noted that today there is another opportunity to remind the world of the tragic consequences of nuclear testing and to encourage the global community to act more decisively on its definite and irreversible ban.
In this regard, on August 29, 2012, at the International Conference From a Nuclear Test Ban to a Nuclear-Weapons-Free World in Astana, I announced the launch by Kazakhstan of an international campaign, The ATOM Project.
The name of the project was composed from the first letters of the words in English - Abolish Testing. Our Mission.
As part of the Project any human on the Earth who opposes nuclear weapons, can sign an online petition at www.theatomproiect.org and urge the governments of the world to permanently abandon nuclear testing and to achieve the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the President emphasized.
In his letter, the President of Kazakhstan called on the Hiroshima Youth Committee and all the people of good will to support the ATOM Project and to make the establishment of a world without nuclear weapons our most important objective.

Today President Nursultan Nazarbayev Participates in the CICA Summit
participation in events
Among the participants of the event were foreign ministers of the CICA and representatives of several international organizations.
In his speech, President Nursultan Nazarbayev noted that on October 5, 1992, speaking from the rostrum of the 47-th session of the UN General Assembly, he proposed to form on the Asian continent an interstate dialogue platform for the elaboration of confidence building measures in various areas of cooperation.
Today, two decades later, the CICA has turned into an effective forum of multilateral diplomacy, which now includes 24 countries occupying over 90 percent of the Asia’s territory, where a half the population of our planet live.
I express gratitude to all countries for their support of this initiative, for their membership in the Organization over these 20 years and for their contribution to the development of the Organization.
Also let me congratulate you on the upcoming 20th anniversary of the CICA and thank all participants for their continued support and invaluable contribution to raising the efficiency of our forum, the President said.
President Nazarbayev emphasized that over the recent years immense work had been done and significant results have been achieved.
Over the past two years, Vietnam, Iraq, Bahrain, and Cambodia have become full members of the CICA.
Bangladesh and the Philippines joined it as observer countries.
The Asian continent is turning into the main area of global international relations of the 21st century, both in terms of its economic potential and the degree of influence on world politics.
Today, the countries in the region produce more than 57% of global GDP.
However, unfortunately, unresolved inter-state problems related to territorial disputes are exacerbating in Asia.
At the same time, the Asian region is also an area with the highest concentration of states which possess nuclear weapons and actively increase their military potential, the head of state highlighted.
President Nazarbayev emphasized that it is obvious that it will be difficult to make significant progress in addressing global security issues without strengthening trust among Asian countries.
In this regard, there is a need to make maximum use of Forum’s potential for adoption of joint measures on security and cooperation in Asia.
Kazakhstan is one of the leaders of the movement for nuclear-free world.
We have made historical contribution to this process, having closed the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site and given up nuclear weapons, which has been in the ownership of Kazakhstan.
We call on all countries to adopt the Universal Declaration of a Nuclear Weapons Free World.
We understand that such a complicated issue requires time to solve it.
But we should begin this process for the sake of the humanity.
Kazakhstan's initiative, launched at the Global Nuclear Security Summits in Washington and Seoul, to create an international nuclear fuel bank in Kazakhstan under the auspices of the IAEA has been generally developed, the President said.
The President of Kazakhstan emphasized that there are various multilateral regional and trans-regional formations functioning in the Asian-Pacific region.
At the same time, unlike Europe with its developed organizations in the filed of security, Asia still does not have a system of a continent-wide scale, like the OSCE.
In this context, the CICA is becoming more relevant as an institutional instrument for maintaining security and cooperation in the region.
The Declaration on Principles Guiding Relations between CICA Member States, the Almaty Act and the CICA Catalogue of Confidence Building Measures contain the political and legal basis for the Asian security system.
The CICA member states worked out the joint vision on key security topics in the world and in the region.
We hope that the Conference has the potential to become a full-fledged organization.
In this regard, the President expressed the hope that certain results will be achieved by the fourth Summit of the CICA to establish the organization.
including the improvement of the status of the Head of the Secretariat of the CICA from the Executive Director to the level of the Secretary General.
Besides, the President of Kazakhstan proposed to consider the issue on establishment of the Standing Committee of the CICA, with the introduction of corresponding amendments to the existing Rules of Procedure.
There is also a need to continue and develop cooperation between CICA and the OSCE, which could transform into the creation of a common platform of the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security.
Moreover, similar proposals on cooperation with CICA are received from the OSCE.
Today, at a time when Asia is experiencing rapid development, we are particularly requires a comprehensive and effective Institute of security and cooperation.
In this context, the CICA should take a worthy place in the new global security architecture.
It is natural that effectiveness, efficiency and development of the forum depend on active participation of every member of our Organization, each of the state which you represent.
I hope that our joint active work will make our organization efficient and effective.
I am convinced that there will no any unsettled problems in Asia, if we match them against efficient cooperation and constructive trust between the member states.
This understanding inspires us with hope and strengthens our faith in the bright future of our sub-continent and the whole world, Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu noted that the 20th anniversary of the organization is a historic moment for the CICA process.
We remember that 20 years ago, when President Nursultan Nazarbayev first announced the idea of CICA at the UN General Assembly it was just a desire.
Today the CICA is a trans-regional organization, covering a large part of the population of the world and includes 24 member states and 8 observer states.
We witness that the CICA is an example of how the initiative to ensure regional security may become a reality.
Turkey is proud of holding the chairmanship of this Organization.
We thank Kazakhstan for the leadership in the process of the CICA and intensive work carried out to organize this anniversary session.

Kazakhstan’s way – 2050:
common aim, common interests, common future
Dear fellow citizens!
Distinguished Members of Parliament!
A year ago I announced the new political course for Kazakhstan until 2050.
The main goal is to join the group of 30 most developed countries.
This project is called Eternal Kazakhstan. It is a mature vision of a new era in the history of our country.
Over the last 22 years Kazakhstan has accomplished a great deal.
We have created our own successful model of development.
Every citizen is immensely proud of their country.
They have faith in tomorrow and believe in the future of Kazakhstan.
97 percent of our citizens recognize the stability of their social-economic condition and its continuous improvement year to year.
Today the achievements of our country are the national pride of every citizen.
Strong and powerful countries are formed on long-term vision and stable economic development.
Strategy Kazakhstan - 2050 is a modernization path for all areas to provide sustainable growth.
It is a big challenge, which will test and strengthen our country, our unity, our courage and our efforts.
Our common duty and responsibility is to implement the strategy flawlessly and overcome this test without failures!
Dear fellow citizens!
Kazakhstan of the 21st century is a country created from scratch in just two decades by talented, hardworking and tolerant people!
This is our creation in which we take huge pride!
It is our great creation that we wholeheartedly love!
We’ve adopted Strategy-2050 so that Kazakhstan’s people can hold firmly in their hands the helm of the country's future.
Today, many successful countries – China, Malaysia and Turkey – follow their long-term strategies.
Strategic planning is a ‘number one’ rule in the 21st century.
no wind will be favorable unless a country does not know its route and destination harbor.
Strategy Kazakhstan 2050, as a guiding beacon, allows us to solve our people’s everyday issues, while also keeping our priority aims in mind.
This means that we should improve the life of our nation not in 30 or 50 years’ time, but do so every year.
The Strategy is a program of concrete practical actions, which on a daily basis will improve our country and the life of every citizen of Kazakhstan.
However, everyone must understand that, in market conditions, we must work effectively, rather than wait for manna from heaven.
The government’s task is to provide all conditions for this.
I am convinced that the prosperous future of our homeland lies among developed countries. Achieving this ambition will unite the people of Kazakhstan forever.
Today, I want to present our plan for joining the 30 most developed countries of the world.
On my instruction, the Government has drafted a detailed plan for Kazakhstan to take its place among the top 30 countries.
I gave my overall endorsement to this document, which will be finally approved after revision to fit my instructions in this Address.
According to many forecasts, the next 15-17 years will be a window of opportunity for large-scale breakthrough development of Kazakhstan.
During this period, we will have a favorable external environment, rising demand for resources, energy and food, and the growth of the Third Industrial Revolution.
We should make benefit of this time.
The process of achieving the goals for 2050 will proceed against the background of intense global competition.
Forthcoming decades will bring many well-known challenges, as well as numerous unexpected situations, new crises in global markets and world politics.
There will be no easy ride in the 21st century.
The middle of the century is already not too distant.
Developed countries take this into account in their specific strategies.
The second third of the 21st century will definitely be more difficult, and the number of candidates to the global list of top 30 will be very limited.
I have repeatedly noted that the concept of a developed country is a category that changes over time.
In developed countries, we see fundamentally new qualities in the life of people.
Today the member states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) represent basic indicators of developed countries.
This organization brings together 34 countries that produce more than 60 percent of global GDP.
There are six more candidates to join the OECD: Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa.
The OECD member countries have undergone the path of deep modernization.
They now demonstrate high rates of investment, scientific research, productivity, a large share of small and medium-sized businesses, and high standards of living.
These indicators of OECD countries provide a natural benchmark for Kazakhstan on our way to joining the top 30 developed nations of the world.
I set the task to introduce in Kazakhstan a number of principles and standards of the OECD.
They are reflected in the draft Plan.
In our economy, we plan to reach annual GDP growth not less than four percent.
We should increase the volume of investment from the current 18 percent of the country’s GDP to 30 percent.
The development of knowledge-based economy aims to see the share of non-oil products in Kazakhstan's export potential rise to 70 percent.
The development of new high-tech sectors of the economy will require increase in financing of science to the minimum level of 3 percent of GDP.
It is necessary to halve the energy intensity of the GDP.
By 2050, small and medium-sized businesses will produce at least 50 percent of Kazakhstan's GDP, instead of the current 20 percent.
Labor productivity should grow five-fold, from the current $24,500 to $126,000.
The main benchmarks of the SOCIAL SECTOR development until 2050 are provided in concrete indicators.
We should increase by 4.5 times our GDP per capita, from $13,000 to $60,000.
Kazakhstan will become a country where the middle class makes up a predominant share of the population.
Following the global trend, the share of our urban population will increase from the current 55 percent to roughly 70 percent.
The cities and settlements of Kazakhstan will be linked by high-quality roads and high-speed transport.
The maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, and advances in medicine will help increase the life expectancy in Kazakhstan to 80 years and above.
Kazakhstan will become one of the leading Eurasian centers of medical tourism.
The building of an advanced and competitive national educational system will be completed.
Kazakhstan has to become one of the most SAFE AND COMFORTABLE COUNTRIES FOR LIVING.
Peace and stability, justice and rule of law are the basis of a developed country.
Fellow citizens!
Our Plan for Kazakhstan joining the top 30 developed countries of the world includes long-term priorities for our activity.
It requires us to address a number of challenges in the following priority areas.
FIRST.
It is important to adjust and strengthen the trend of innovative industrialization.
I gave instructions to the Government to design a draft of the Second Five-Year Plan for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development for 2016-2019.
We need to limit the number of priorities for industrialization.
It is important to increase the effectiveness of traditional mining sectors.
They are our natural competitive advantage.
We need to adopt new approaches to the management, production and processing of hydrocarbons, to maximize the export potential of the energy sector.
We need to make final decisions on possible future scenarios for oil and gas production.
It is important to increase the development of rare earth metals, taking into account their importance for knowledge-based industries – electronics, laser technology, telecommunications and medical equipment.
Kazakhstan should enter the world market of geological exploration.
We need to attract investment from foreign engineering companies to this industry by simplifying legislation.
In general, we should have separate plans for the development of traditional industries.
Each of the next five-year plans should end up with an emergence of new industries in our economy.
During the first five-year plan, we developed production capability in the automotive and aircraft industries, as well as locomotives, passenger and freight car production.
We should expand these products and export them to external markets.
So, the remaining years until 2050 are divided into seven five-year periods, each aimed at achieving the goal of becoming one of top 30 developed countries.
During the second and subsequent five-year plans, we should establish the industries of mobile and multimedia technology, nanotechnology and space technology, robotics, genetic engineering, and future energy exploration.
The key priority of the Government’s work is to create most favorable conditions for Kazakhstan's business, mainly small and medium-sized enterprises.
In the next 10-15 years, it is necessary to develop a knowledge-intensive basis for the economy.countries.
Without this basis we cannot join the group of developed countries.
And it must be founded on advanced science.
SECOND.
We need to ensure that our AGRICULTURE takes the path of innovations.
This is our traditional industry.
The global demand for food will increase.
This sector will attract more investment.
This will enable farmers to look beyond short-term weather-related achievements to the long-term growth of production.
Competition in the global agro-production will intensify.
Agricultural lands should be used by those who introduce new technologies, continuously improve productivity, and perform on the basis of the best international standards.
First and foremost, it is important to develop an effective land market, particularly through transparent pricing mechanisms.
Once investment and introduction of advanced technologies become pre-requisites for farmland leasing, it will increase competition.
We should remove all barriers that impede business development in agriculture, farmers’ cooperation and efficient land use.
The future lies in the creation of a network of new processing enterprises in the agricultural sector, mainly in the form of small and medium-sized businesses.
In this area we should provide loans to business.
Farmers should have direct access to long-term financing and markets without intermediaries.
Also important is the creation of an effective system of guarantees and insurance of loans to rural producers.
Kazakhstan should become a major regional exporter of meat, dairy and farming products.
In crop farming, we should reduce the volume of unprofitable water-intensive crops cultivation and switch to vegetable, oilseed and forage production.
We need a set of measures to drive the efficient use of agrochemicals, and increased use of modern technology of zero tillage and other innovations in arid regions.
According to the Plan for the transition to the green economy by 2030, 15 percent of acreage will be converted to water-saving technologies.
We need to develop agricultural science and create experimental agro-innovation clusters.
It is important to keep up with the pace of time, and along with the production of natural food, develop drought-tolerant, genetically modified crops.
Given the designated tasks, I charge the Government to adjust the planning for agriculture development.
THIRD.
The development of knowledge-based economy is, above all, the increase of the capacity of science in Kazakhstan.
In this area we should improve legislation on venture financing, intellectual property protection, research and innovation support, as well as commercialization of research.
I charge the Government before September 1 of this year to develop and submit to the Parliament a package of relevant bills.
We need a concrete plan for the gradual increase of science financing for specific research and scientific discoveries.
To accelerate the transfer of knowledge and new technologies to the country, we need to fully use the potential of foreign direct investment.
In cooperation with foreign companies we need to set up design and engineering centers.
We need to invite the leading transnational companies operating in major oil and gas and mining facilities to establish production facilities for their own needs and services here, in Kazakhstan.
I know some large companies are ready for this.
The Government must elaborate on this issue and provide favorable conditions for the process if necessary.
There is no need to import equipment from abroad, if we can produce it in our country.
It is important to improve the efficiency of the national innovation system and its basic institutions.
Their activities should be oriented to supporting start-ups and venture deals at early stages.
It is necessary to increase activity in technology parks, mainly in large urban agglomerations, primarily in Astana and Almaty.
In Astana, the first intellectual innovation cluster is already successfully operating around Nazarbayev University.
In Almaty there is an Alatau Information Technology Park.
We need to think about bringing spin-off production sites of large local companies into the clusters.
FOURTH.
We have to ensure dynamic development of the infrastructure triad — AGGLOMERATIONS, TRANSPORTATION, AND ENERGY.
Agglomerations are the foundation of the knowledge-based economy of Kazakhstan.
Their creation and development are an important challenge given the vast territory of our country and its low population density.
The largest cities of Kazakhstan, Astana and Almaty, Shymkent and Aktobe must become contemporary urban centers driving economic growth.
They should become centers of science and investment, attract talent, and provide high-quality education, healthcare, social, and cultural services.
Transport infrastructure is at the heart of industrial economy and society.
I have said many times that it is impossible to reach the level of a developed country without modern high-quality highways.
As we are located between Europe and Asia, between the North and the South, transportation remains of great importance to Kazakhstan.
To set up a network of internal roads, we have initiated construction of highways Astana-Karaganda-Almaty, Astana-Pavlodar-Ust’-Kamenogorsk, Almaty-Kapchagay-Ust-Kamenogorsk.
These routes are already used by trains that are twice as fast.
We need to develop the logistics services sector.
First of all, it is a question of the maximum use of the Customs Union territory for transportation of our goods.
The construction works of the Western Europe – Western China corridor are coming to an end.
We have built a new railway to Turkmenistan and Iran with an access to the Persian Gulf.
In the future, Kazakhstan must invest in the creation of logistics centers in countries with access to the sea.
It is necessary to reduce the customs clearance time for goods, increase the capacity of border checkpoints, strengthen the efficiency of the Aktau seaport, and simplify exporting and importing procedures.
We are constructing the new 1200 km long railway Zhezkazghan – Shalkar – Beineu.
This railway will connect the country’s west and east, reviving activities in the regional centers.
This grand construction is to be completed in 2015.
These routes will enable us, through the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus, to reach Europe.
and, in the East, the Lianyungang seaport bordering the Pacific Ocean, upon which there is an agreement with the People’s Republic of China.
We are going to develop the traditional energy sector.
It is necessary to support research in cleaning fossil-fuel power plants’ emissions and in energy saving, in industry and household, based on the most sophisticated technologies.
Recently, ten largest companies of the European Union publicly opposed the EU energy strategy based on the well-known concept of the green economy.
Over the four years of its implementation, the European Union has lost 51 gigawatt of energy power.
In our green energy program, we have to take into account all of these mistakes.
Preparation for the international exhibition EXPO 2017 in Astana should be used to establish a center for the study and implementation of the world’s best research and the creation of future energy.
A team of specialists, under the auspices of Nazarbayev University, should lead this work.
We should create conditions for the transition of our public transport to environmentally friendly fuels, introduce electric cars, and create the necessary infrastructure for them.
The country needs large-scale production of gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation kerosene.
We need to construct a new oil-processing refinery.
At the same time, we should not forget about development of nuclear energy.
The demand for cheap nuclear energy, in the foreseeable future, will only increase.
Kazakhstan is the world leader in uranium production.
We have to develop our own fuel industry and build nuclear power stations.
FIFTH.
SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS development is the main tool for the industrial and social modernization of Kazakhstan in the 21st century.
In this respect my position, as it is known, is well-defined, and I have expressed it many times.
The greater the share of small-to-medium-sized businesses in our economy is, the more developed and sustainable Kazakhstan will be.
Currently we have more than 800,000 small-to-medium-size enterprises employing 2.4 million of our citizens.
Production in this sector has increased 1.6 times over the past four years and equals more than 8.3 billion tenge.
According to the global ranking, Kazakhstan has joined the group of countries with the most favorable conditions for doing business.
We have to reinforce this trend.
Small and medium-sized business is the economic basis of our Universal Labor Society.
For its development we need to comprehensively address private property rights.
It is necessary to repeal all the outdated legal norms impeding business development.
Small business should become a family tradition, passed down from generation to generation.
It is important to support the specialization of small business as they grow in size.
We need clear bankruptcy procedures for such enterprises.
Small and medium-sized business should develop around new innovative companies.
I charged the Government to combine the next five-year industrialization plan with the Business road map 2020.
The Government, together with the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan, should establish effective support mechanisms for new entrepreneurs.
SIXTH.
Our path to the future is related to creating NEW OPPORTUNITIES to UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL of our citizens.
A developed country in the 21st century has active, educated, enterprising and healthy citizens.
What do we need to achieve this?
First, all developed countries have a unique high-quality education system.
We have a great deal of work to do to improve the quality of all parts of national education.
By 2020 we expect all Kazakhstan’s children from three to six years to be in preschool education.
Therefore it is important to provide these children with modern education methods and qualified personnel.
In the secondary education, it is necessary to improve the standard of teaching in all schools to the level of Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools.
High school graduates should speak Kazakh, Russian and English.
The result of teaching should be mastery of critical thinking skills, independent research and in-depth analysis of information.
In the period up to 2017, we need to eliminate the lack of space in schools and convert schools to a two-shift study system where it is necessary.
Government and akims (governors) should adjust the budgetary allocation to this task.
In the next two-three years, we need to create a core of a national system of dual technical and professional education.
We need to move to a guarantee by the government of a technical education for young people.
I charge the Government to submit concrete proposals on this issue by June 1, 2014.
We need to start a gradual transition of our leading universities to academic and administrative autonomy.
I believe it necessary to establish an effective system of student support for high performers.
I charge the Government to provide the increase of scholarships by 25 percent from January 1, 2016.
Second, the main priority in healthcare is primary care services.
The introduction of compulsory health insurance should be considered.
The joint responsibility of the state, the employer and the employee for his/her health is the main principle of the entire health care system.
Sports, proper diet, regular preventive examinations are the foundation of disease prevention.
Thirdly, we must provide new impetus for Kazakhstan’s cultural development.
The long-term Concept of the cultural policy should be developed.
It is necessary to identify measures aimed at creating a competitive cultural mentality of the Kazakhstan people and the development of modern cultural clusters.
Kazakh language has become the language of science, knowledge and Internet.
The number of students studying in Kazakh has increased over the years.
There are now 57 centers across the country that teach the state language.
Thousands of citizens have learned Kazakh in these centers, and there are people who are in the process of learning the language.
This year, the number of representatives of other ethnicities who speak Kazakh has increased by 10 percent, compared with last year.
It reveals the important changes that are underway.
Only over the past three years, 10 billion tenge was allocated across the country to develop the state language.
There is one fact that no one can change!
Our native language has become the Eternal Language in our Eternal Land.
We should consider it not as a ground for debates, but as a foundation to unite our country.
Fourth, we should revise social packages for people working in education, healthcare and social security sectors.
I charge the Government to develop and implement a new model of pay system for civil servants from July 1, 2015.
It should provide an increase in the salaries of healthcare employees by 28 percent, in the education sector – by 29 percent, and in the social security sector – by 40 percent.
Fifth, we must do more to support our citizens with disabilities.
Kazakhstan must become a barrier-free zone for them.
It is our duty to take care of those people.
The countries around the world tackle these issues.
People with disabilities can work in the service sector, food processing and agriculture industries.
I am calling upon our businesses to encourage the employment of people with disabilities.
An introduction of a special quota of up to five-ten people should be considered.
We will incorporate these people into active life, and they will not only receive disability benefits, but also feel themselves full-fledged members of the society.
All social institutions, non-profit organizations, and the Nur Otan party have to start addressing this issue.
The Government needs to coordinate the process with other actors and make respective decisions.
I charge the Government to increase by 25 percent the amount of social benefits for those with disabilities and those who lost their breadwinner, starting July 1, 2015.
The legal framework for associations of disabled persons should be improved.
All government entities - from the Central Government to the local akims – should intensify this work.
We must continue reducing poverty and tackling unemployment.
At the same time, it is important not to allow welfare mentality to grow.
For all recipients of state allowances and aid, it is necessary to introduce a rule for mandatory participation in employment programs and social adaptation.
SEVENTH.
Improving PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.
As we move towards the top 30 developed countries, we need an atmosphere of creativity, fair competition, rule of law, and high standards of legal culture.
We need renewed instruments of interaction between the state, the non-government sector and business.
Equality before the law should become the real basis of the law and order.
The judicial system should become transparent and accessible in practice, resolving all disputes in a simple and rapid manner.
It is necessary to increase the quality of the entire law enforcement system.
Men in uniform, provided with great authority, have to demonstrate high standards of behavior and professionalism.
An important task is to create and implement the new anti-corruption strategy.
Administrative reform should not turn into a cumbersome process of unnecessary paperwork and document circulation.
We should give more independence to local authorities, while increasing their responsibility for results and their accountability to the people.
I charge the Government, together with my Administration, to submit a set of proposals on all these issues by 1 July 2014.
It is necessary to keep on putting into practice the meritocracy principles in the management of human resources in state-owned enterprises, national companies, and state budget-financed organizations.
I charge the Government to ensure the wages of the B corps civil servants grow by 15% since 1 July 2015, and by another 15% since 1 July 2016.
These are clear goals our country and our society will face on their way to the top 30 developed countries.
We will have to translate them into relevant legislation and concrete actions.
Distinguished Members of Parliament and Government!
Our movement towards the top 30 developed countries should proceed in two stages.
The first stage embraces the period before 2030, during which we will have to make a modernization breakthrough using a window of opportunity in the 21st century.
It requires Kazakhstan to achieve what the developed countries accomplished during the industrial boom of the last century.
This is feasible.
South Korea and Singapore followed this path.
At this stage, we will ensure dynamic growth of our traditional sectors and create a strong manufacturing industry.
During the second stage, between 2030 and 2050, we need to ensure sustainable development of the country on the principles of the knowledge-based economy.
We will build a strong manufacturing industry.
In our traditional sectors, we will move to high-end products. Engineering services will be developed as a basis for the knowledge-based economy.
Now I want to focus on what has to be done this year, taking into account that our future achievements depend on how well we begin.
I am charging the Government and the National Bank with seven specific tasks.
First.
The Government has to ensure the economic growth of 6-7%.
This year, GDP per capita will have to be not less than $14,500.
Second.
By May 1, 2014, the National Bank, together with the Government, has to develop a set of measures to bring inflation down to 3-4% in the medium term.
Third.
By June 1, 2014, the Government and the National Bank have to develop a comprehensive financial sector development program to run until 2030.
Fourth.
The Government, together with the Fund Samruk-Kazyna, should analyse all state-owned companies, define a list of enterprises to be privatized.
The same work should be done for the rest of the public sector.
In the first quarter of the current year, a comprehensive privatization program for 2014-2016 has to be adopted.
Fifth.
By the end of the year, the Government has to prepare draft strategies on the formation of agglomerations in Astana and Almaty for the period until 2030.
Sixth.
By September 1, 2014, the Government has to prepare Kazakhstan’s transit potential development program until 2030, envisaging the removal of barriers to international trade.
Seventh.
By the end of the first quarter of this year, the Government has to agree on the location, investment sources, and construction schedule for a nuclear power plant and fourth oil refinery.
Fellow citizens!
My comrades-in-arms!
All our actions designed to reach the main goal of the 2050 Strategy have to follow clear principles.
Firstly, pragmatism and the evolutionary nature of all decisions.
No leaps, thoughtless experiments or adventures should be accepted in the economy, politics, or social life.
Our country and society will change as fast as the surrounding world.
Secondly, mutually beneficial openness.
We will attract a wide range of foreign investments, technologies, and innovations to our economy.
We will create favorable conditions for the investors.
We see the deepening integration of our economy in regional and global economic systems as an important mechanism for joining the top 30 developed countries.
This is, above all, linked to our participation in building the Eurasian Economic Union and joining the World Trade Organization.
Thirdly, reinforcing our citizens’ wellbeing.
The social conditions of ordinary people should be the most important indicator of our progress towards the major goal.
Fourthly, nationwide support is very important.
My Address to the people is in itself the main document explaining our goals and objectives.
Each minister, local governor and company head has to explain and lead these activities and involve everyone they manage in this work.
Each citizen has to be informed of specific measures that are taken in order to achieve the goals stated in the Address.
To this end, first of all, public servants have to know and be imbued with the ideas of our Strategy.
The President’s Administration and the Government have to work to enable the achievement of all of these objectives.
On the whole, the structure of public institutions has to fit the achievement of the goals ahead of us and make sure we achieve the 2050 Strategy goals.
Fellow citizens!
We, the people of Kazakhstan, are a united nation!
And our shared destiny - our Mangilik Yel or the Eternal Land – is our great country of Kazakhstan!
Mangilik Yel is the national idea of our shared Kazakh home.
Over the past 22 years of our sovereignty and development we have formed our core values, they are the foundation of our country’s future and unite all the people of Kazakhstan.
They are not taken from mystical stories or theories.
These values are the embodiment of Kazakhstan’s Way, which has withstood the test of time.
First of all, it is the independence of Kazakhstan and our Astana.
Second, our national unity, peace and harmony are foremost in our society.
Third, it is a secular society with high spirituality.
Fourth, economic growth based on industrialization and innovation.
Fifth, it is the Universal Labor Society.
Sixth, we have a common history, culture and language.
Seventh, it is our country’s national security and its engagement in addressing global and regional issues.
With these values, we have triumphed, strengthened our country, multiplied our achievements.
There is an ideological foundation of the New Kazakhstan Patriotism in these state forming and nationwide values.
I charge the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan, together with the National Movement Kazakhstan - 2050, to organize the drafting and adoption of a Patriot Act Mangilik Yel.
I call upon all political parties, public associations, all the citizens of Kazakhstan to actively participate in the achievement of the main goals of the Strategy - 2050!
I particularly appeal to our youth.
This strategy is for you.
You, who will participate in its implementation, and you will reap the benefits of its success.
Get involved in these efforts, each in your workplace.
Do not be indifferent.
Help create the destiny of the country together with the whole nation!
My dear fellow citizens!
Mangilik Yel (the Eternal Land) has been a precious dream for many thousands of years.
It is a dream of becoming an Independent Country that has equal relations with other countries and has its own place on the world map.
It is a dream of becoming a happy country that allows its citizens to have fulfilling lives and to look at the future with faith.
We have made our dreams come true.
We have laid the foundation of the Eternal Land.
I noticed people asking What should be the national idea of the people ofKazakhstan?
There is an idea that shows us the direction to the future, that consolidates the nation and leads to the accomplishment of great ambitions.
It is the idea of Mangilik Yel – the Eternal Land.
With Independence, we have accomplished our Great Ambitions.
We have founded our Eternal Capital - the heart of our country, the base of our independence.
The achievements of Kazakh people (Mangilik Gumur) will help us build The Great Future (Mangilik Bolashak).
The next generation is the children of the Great Kazakh people.
Therefore, the national idea of Kazakhstan is the Eternal Land!
The concept of the Eternal Land (Mangilik El) is the foundation of the nation’s great course – strategy Kazakhstan-2050.
It is more difficult to sustain the independence than to achieve it.
It is a centuries-old truth, proved by many nations in the world.
Mutual hostility and lack of cohesion have caused the disappearance of many nations.
Many nations are lost forever having been unable to withstand the tests of time.
We must learn from the mistakes of others and draw lessons from the past.
One lesson is that the creation of the Eternal Land lies in our own hands.
We need to encourage ourselves to keep moving forward.
We absolutely must preserve our Undeniable Independence, that is our wealth and our happiness.
Kazakhstan – 2050 is the most honorary and the most decent way to lead to the Eternal Land.
Let’s not move away from this path, my dear nation!
May everyday be festive and every effort be beneficial!
May the development be rapid and the future be prosperous!
May our country continue to surprise the world with its great achievements!

Now, a fair decision has been made.

Kashagan is one of the largest oil fields and gas reservoirs in the world.
In order to exploit it, Kazakhstan inked a production sharing agreement with the largest transnational corporations.
However, because these companies could not meet the outlined deadlines of production start, Kazakhstan was loosing its share of profit.
Due to that, last summer I instructed the Government to hold negotiations in order to protect Kazakhstan’s interests in this project.
We had very complicated talks that drew attention of international media and world community.
After long and difficult negotiations, the Kazakhstani side has protected its interests.
The KazMunayGas Company doubles its share in the project, and this will increase our profits in the future.
I believe this is good news to our country.
KazMunayGas is becoming a large company even in international scale and will be able to attract more investments.
This was very important.
Today’s meeting demonstrates that we all are satisfied with the results.
We have prevented the contract’s breach that was possible in the case if we did not agree.
Both companies-investors and the Kazakhstani side are pleased with the results of the talks, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized.

The Flag of the Republic of Kazakhstan
The Flag is one of the main symbols of the state that represents its sovereignty and identity.
The Russian term flag for Flag comes from the Dutch word Vlag and means cloth of officially adopted size and colour and commonly with an image of emblem (coat of arms).
It was designed by Shaken Niyazbekov.
The State Flag of the Republic of Kazakhstan is a rectangular breadth of blue colour with the image of the sun in its center with a soaring steppe eagle underneath.
Along the flagstaff there is a vertical band with the national ornamental patterns.
The images of the sun, rays, eagle and ornament are of golden colour.
The ratio of the Flag’s width to its length: 1:2.
In heraldry each colour has its own specific meaning.
Thus, a blue-sky colour symbolizes honesty, fidelity and integrity.
Moreover, the blue-sky colour has a deep symbolic meaning in Turkic culture.
The ancient Turkic peoples always worship the Sky as their God, and their blue-sky banner symbolized devotion to Father Ancestor.
The blue colour of the State Flag of Kazakhstan means pure sky, peace and prosperity, and self-colour of the background represents the unity of our country.
According to the heraldic principles the sun symbolizes wealth and abundance, life and energy.
That is why the sun rays on the flag have the form of grain, a symbol of wealth and welfare.
By representing the sun at its state attributes Kazakhstan reaffirms its commitment to universal values, which also indicates that the new young country is full of life-affirming energy and is open to all countries for cooperation.
The image of the steppe eagle is one of the main heraldic attributes which is used on coat of arms and flags of various peoples for centuries.
This image is commonly considered as a symbol of power, insight and generosity.
A soaring steppe eagle represents by itself a power of the state, its sovereignty and independence, aspiration to high goals and sustainable future.
The image of the steppe eagle on the world outlook of Eurasian nomads has a special place and is associated with such notions as freedom and fidelity, sense of dignity and courage, strength and purity of thoughts.
The symbolically rendered silhouette of the golden steppe eagle reflects aspiration of the young sovereign state to the heights of world civilization.
Another important element of the State Flag is a vertical band with the national ornamental patterns.
This Kazakh ornament is one of the forms of specific artistic perception of world in strict accordance with aesthetic styles of the people.
Representing a harmony of various forms and lines, it is also an expressive means of discovery of the inner world of the people.
The national ornament along the flagstaff represents the art and cultural traditions of the people of Kazakhstan.

The President also added that Government failed to achieve full support for necessary expenses of the budget without the use of the National Fund.

What we earn is not enough.
Our work on industrialization, the development of non-primary resources of the economy are designed for us to get the funds to cover the budget in other ways without having to use the National Fund and the money that comes from the export of our raw materials.
The National Fund should be used for the development of our country, including the lending of the funds and making money within, but not outside our state.
The execution of my state-of-the-nation address, some serious challenges for the further development of the state and social modernization all require certain costs.
This is why, we established the National Fund.
One part of the fund is intended for future generations and another part is for transfers and the present-day development of the economy.
Large facilities, such as railways, which Kazakhstan will require in the future, the issues of affordable housing, employment programmes will all require additional funding for implementation in addition to the budget money.
The state-of-the-nation address has received a great response from the people and the public now have very high expectations that we must fulfill, Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed.

The Emblem of the Republic of Kazakhstan
The Emblem is one of the main symbols of the state.
The Russian term gerb for Emblem comes from the German word Erbe (legacy).
it  means hereditary distinctive sign that represents a combination of figures and objects to which a symbolic sense reflecting cultural and historical traditions of the state is given.
The history is an evidence of the fact that the nomads of the Bronze Age that inhabited the territory of modern Kazakhstan identified themselves with a special symbol which is called totem.
This term has been for the first time used in the Turkic Khaganate.
The Emblem of the sovereign Kazakhstan was officially adopted in 1992.
The authors of the State Emblem are Kazakhstan’s famous architects Zhandarbek Malibekov and Shot-Aman Ualikhanov.
The State Emblem of the Republic of Kazakhstan has the shape of a circle (wheel).
It is a symbol of life and eternity that was especially valued among the nomads of the Great Steppes.
The central heraldic element of the State Emblem is the image of shanyrak (an arched cross-shaped top of the Kazakh yurt) against a sky blue background which irradiates uyks (supports or bearings of the yurt) in the form of sunrays to all sides.
On both right and left of shanyrak there are images of mythical winged quarter horses.
At the top of Emblem there is a volumetric five-pointed star.
There is also the inscription Kazakhstan at the bottom of the Emblem.
The images of shanyrak, uyks, and mythical horses, as well as the inscriptions Kazakhstan, have the colour of gold.
Shanyrak is a main backbone part of the yurt that resembles a blue sky. It is also one of the key elements of Kazakh family dwelling in the traditional culture of Eurasian nomads.
The image of shanyrak on the State Emblem of the republic is a symbol of common home and common homeland of all people living in Kazakhstan.
The stable development of Kazakhstan depends on welfare of each citizen just like the strength and stability of shanyrak depends on reliability of all its uyks.
The winged mythical horses, tulpars, are the key heraldic element of the State Emblem.
The image of the horse stands for such notions as bravery since time immemorial.
The wings symbolize a centuries-old dream of multinational people of Kazakhstan to build a strong and prosperous nation.
They represent pure thoughts and aspiration to successive and constructive development.
The golden wings of racers also resemble golden sheaves of grain that are a sign of labor of the people of Kazakhstan and material welfare of the country.
In centuries past the horns are often used during ceremonial rites of nomads as well as a finial to their fighting banners.
The images of heavenly grace, fertility of the earth and the military fortune in the form of various animals’ horns are always considered as integral parts in symbolic compositions of different peoples.
Therefore, a winged horse with a horn of plenty is an important typological image which has deep semantic and historical roots.
Another element on the coat of arms is a five-pointed star.
This symbol is used by man from ancient times and represents constant aspiration of people to the light of truth and the pursuit of the sublime and eternal matter.
The image of a star on the State Emblem reflects the dream of people to build a state open to all countries of the world for cooperation and partnership.
Hearts and arms of the people of Kazakhstan are open to representatives from all five continents.
The primary colour of the State Emblem is the colour of gold.
it serves as a symbol of wealth, justice and magnanimity.
The colour of blue sky symbolizes a serene sky, peace and prosperity.

Prosecutor General A.Daulbayev, chairman of the National Security Committee N.Abykayev and other representatives of state bodies made their reports.
The Head of state concluded on the session.
Dear people of Kazakhstan!
Yesterday, during festivities in the town of Zhanaozen in Mangistau Region, criminal acts committed by a group of individuals led to mass disturbances.
Peaceful citizens who gathered on the central square to commemorate the anniversary of Independence were attacked by a group of hooligans.
The perpetrators attacked the police, destroyed the yurts (tents) arranged on the square for the festivities, and set a police bus on fire.
They were beating up civilians and smashing cars parked near the square, setting them on fire.
In response to the demands of the police to stop their illegal actions, the group of hooligans attacked police officers seeking to seize their weapons.
As a result of the disturbances, the mayor’s office and a nearby village’s administrative office, a hotel and the Ozenmunaigaz company office building were burned down.
Property of physical and juridical persons was also subjected to destruction.
Cars were burned down.
ATM machines, shops, and banks were looted.
A total of 46 facilities were attacked.
In that small town, almost all facilities were attacked, burned or destroyed.
Unfortunately, as a result of disturbances, people died, our citizens.
According to preliminary data, 10 people got killed.
There are heavily wounded people, including among police officers.
I would like to note that police officers were being true to their official duties and were strictly following their authorities under law.
Every dead or wounded person has relatives and close ones.
I express my sincere condolences to them.
The families of those who died and got injured will be provided with assistance.
Criminal cases were initiated in relation to all the cases of violations of the law.
Upon my orders, an investigative team led by the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan has been set up.
This commission will take all necessary measures to identify and bring to justice the organizers of the disturbances, and to restore public security in the town.
Currently, the situation there is under the control of law enforcement bodies.
The perpetrators will be brought to justice under the full force of law.
At the same time, I believe the labour dispute of oil workers must not be mixed in with the acts of bandit elements who sought to abuse the situation in their criminal plots.
We will find out who has financed that and who is doing that.
In recent years, the state has done a lot to improve the social situation in Zhanaozen.
We have raised salaries.
We have welcomed to Zhanaozen fellow countrymen who had lived abroad.
and we have created all the necessary conditions for them.
For that, they should be grateful to the state.
A special commission of the Government and KazMunaiGaz will leave for Zhanaozen to resolve labour disputes and explain to the population what happened and what measures are being taken.
I task the Office of the Prosecutor General, along with other law enforcement agencies, with conducting a thorough investigation of what happened, ensuring maximum openness of information, sharing the results with the people, and, if need be, draw in independent experts.
I should note that these days acts of protests and mass disturbances are taking place in many countries of the world.
To the great extent, these have become the result of a global recession, caused by the global financial and economic crisis.
All of these past years, we have been working to strengthen stability, peace and harmony in our country.
These are our main values, due to which we have reached success.
We will not allow any attempts to upstage peace and harmony in our home, shatter the achievements of our independence.
That is why the people have no reasons for concern.
The situation is under control.
The law is the law.
The demands of the law are equal for all.
The law will be applied in order to ensure security and calm of the people of the town.
The state will use the law to the fullest to stop any attempts to violate calm and security of our citizens.
I call on all the people of Kazakhstan to denounce this incident, alien to our country, and to preserve calm.
I call on the people of Zhanaozen to show wisdom and to keep calm.
We will deal with all of these issues.
In order to restore the economy of the town of Zhanaozen, restore the facilities that were burned down, and, most importantly, ensure the security of the citizens I am issuing a Decree on the introduction of the state of emergency in the town of Zhanaozen according to the Constitution and the Law on the State of Emergency.
It will be in force for 20 days, beginning today.
If we are able to resolve all issues before then, and if calm is ensured, it can be rescinded at any time.

Then, the heads of state went to the station square and met with the railway workers and representatives of the region community.
President Nazarbayev greeted the residents of the region and emphasized the special role of the Mangistau region for the country.
Nursultan Nazarbayev noted that due to the opening of the Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan section of the Uzen-Bereket-Gorgan Railway passing through the territory of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iran, the Mangistau region will provide an access both to the Caspian sea and the southern seas.
Then, the two leaders took part in the Golden Railway Bed ceremony of rail laying.
In his speech, President Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized that the transnational object has a historical importance.
It opens a direct railway communication between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
The new road provides a shortest way of delivery of cargoes, including transit, and passenger traffic in the future.
Time is an important factor nowadays.
Thus, reduction in terms of cargo turnover provides a significant competitive advantage.
In turn, it will increase business activities and in the long run, the growth of welfare of our countries.
Moreover, the Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan railway is a key part of the future transit corridor with an access to the Persian Gulf, President Nazarbayev said.
The President of Kazakhstan pointed out that the realization of this project started in October 2007.
In 2007, together with the presidents of Turkmenistan and Iran we signed a declaration on construction of a highway with the Uzen-Bereket-Gorgan route.
In 2009, we started the construction works.
At present, the works on construction of the Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan railway line has been successfully completed.
In the future, we plan to open the route which will link the transport networks of Central Asia, the Middle East and Europe.
This idea was considered long before the signing of the declaration, Nursultan Nazarbayev highlighted.
The President of Kazakhstan emphasized that the relevance of the project has been further increased over the past years.
The center of gravity both for world trade and production shifted to Asia, strengthening the importance of an access to the Asian markets.
At the same time, the economies of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan showed a stable growth over the last years.
However, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan do not have a direct access to the ocean.
Accumulated production potential has set the task to search for new markets, new points of application of forces, the President of Kazakhstan added.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev noted that the railway communication between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan opens up new opportunities for our businesses, fostering trade and economic growth.
The extending of the route will strengthen these opportunities.
Firstly, we expect the increase in intensity of trade between our countries.
First of all, it is related to practical cooperation of frontier territories of our two countries.
I am confident that the interaction of Mangistau region of Kazakhstan and the Balkan velayat of Turkmenistan will be significantly expanded.
Secondly, we will be able to increase exports in the direction of the Middle East, South and South-East Asia.
Thirdly, we will create a convenient and cost-effective route for a dozens of countries, both in northern and southern directions.
We hope that the Iranian part will be also completed and soon we will celebrate the end of the construction of the railway with further access to the Persian Gulf.
In turn, we receive benefits as transit states, creating new jobs in the sphere of logistics, the President highlighted.
The President of Kazakhstan emphasized that the new railway will give a powerful impetus to the development of the Caspian region, including the expansion of transport, industrial and social infrastructure.
Thus, the highway is a significant contribution to the improvement of the wellbeing of the peoples of our countries.
In addition to direct economic benefits, the railway is an effective way of further strengthening of good-neighborly relations, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
The head of state also noted that the implementation of this project is an indicator of the stability of economies of the two countries.
It proves that we are capable of the most complicated technical, investment and organizational tasks.
Today, when many countries are still recovering from the financial crisis, we have managed to bring the large-scale transport project to the logical completion, the President of Kazakhstan added.
In conclusion, Nursultan Nazarbayev once again thanked Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov for the active support of the project.
A special word of thanks I address everyone, who worked on the project of the railway Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan on all its stages.
Your creative activity has found its embodiment in the road, connecting the states.
I want to wish the peoples of our countries peace, well-being and prosperity, the President of Kazakhstan said.
In turn, President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov said that the laying of the foundation of a new economic space uniting the countries of Central Asia and the Caspian with the Black Sea region, the states of Transcaucasia, will allow to ensure the further exit to the countries of Northern Europe.
Our project implies the connection to the transport infrastructure in the eastern direction, with further access to such economic centers of global development as China, India and the countries of the Asia-Pacific region.
It means the creation of further large-scale format of cooperation from the point of view of geo-economics, as well as innovative vision of the strategic prospects for the development of our countries, the President of Turkmenistan stressed.
Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov also thanked the builders, engineers, designers and all those who directly worked on the construction of the railway.
The implementation of such projects makes our country economically strong, stable and confident in the future of the states, which are connected by true ties of friendship, brotherhood and good neighborliness.
The decisive factor in implementation of the project was the mutual support, unity and coordinated work of the relevant departments of the two countries.
Let me express my deep appreciation to the President of Kazakhstan for his support of this project, mobilizing and directing all the necessary resources for its successful implementation, the President of Turkmenistan said.
The leaders of the two countries also launched the Kazakhstan – Turkmenistan fiber-optic communication line which opens the possibility of organization of connections through the network of JSC Kazakhtelecom with the networks of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Iran, as well as the possibility of transit traffic for Turkmenistan in the direction of Russia, Europe and the countries of South-East Asia.

Today, the President viewed the construction course of the Asar microdistrict, which is being built in Shymkent for our compatriots repatriated to their historical Motherland.

The Ak Ordasy Corporation contractor company will build 1750 cottages that will meet all architectural and constructor standards.
The local government plans to settle 2800 families there.
Constructors have laid foundations of 500 houses and have built walls of 100 houses.
Because the constructors are Kazakh immigrants themselves, the cost of 1 square meter of housing does not exceed 250 US dollars.
Green houses are being built near to the housing estates.
Nursultan Nazarbayev approved such an approach to the problem of Kazakh immigrants housing.
During his meeting with immigrants, the President noted that because of some historical reasons many Kazakhs reside outside Kazakhstan in neighboring countries, namely in China, Uzbekistan, Russia, Turkmenistan, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan.
Some of them live in Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and European countries.
The President underscored Kazakhstan never forgets our compatriots.

Virtually all future residents of the Asar microdistrict are immigrants from Uzbekistan.
In this connection, Nursultan Nazarbayev underscored that they must be thankful to the brotherly state that has a Kazakh population over one million.
Kazakhstan also has 300 thousand people of Uzbek descent.
They are real citizens of our multinational country and make their contribution to its development and prosperity.

Invested in the sector funds return fast and bring significant profits.

The Second Summit of Leaders of the Littoral States of the Caspian Sea Was Held in Tehran
Events
Presidents of Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan met each other in Tehran in order to discuss important issues of determining the legal status of the Caspian Sea.
The Caspian Sea is unique because of its mineral and biological resources and also its ecological system.
According to preliminary data, reserves of only carbohydrate resources are equal to 18 billion tons of standard coal.
Obviously, each of the five littoral states has its own interests in the Sea’s natural resources.
The littoral Caspian states have been working on the Convention determining the legal status of the Caspian Sea for more than ten years.
This document is very important, because it allows determining the property rights to natural and, first of all, to energy resources.
While the Convention is not adopted, the Soviet-Iranian treaties on 26 February, 1921 and on 25 March, 1940 are still be in law.
These documents regulate issues of navigation and fishery, but do not determine procedures of exploiting natural resources fields.
In November 2003, representatives of the Caspian littoral countries signed a Framework Convention on protecting naval environment of the Caspian Sea (Tehran Convention), which came into force on 12 August, 2006.
This was the first document adopted in pentalateral format.
Its main objective is to ensure ecological security of the unique Sea and protect it against pollution caused by the exploitation of its carbohydrate resources.
In addition, three Caspian littoral countries, namely Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan regulated all disputable issues in the northern part of the Caspian Sea when signed a trilateral Agreement determining the point of intersection between neighboring parts of the Caspian Sea’s bottom.
The document has legalized more than 60 percents of the Sea’s water-surface area in trilateral format.
While addressing the auditory, Kazakhstan’s President reminded that the first pentalateral summit was held in Ashgabat in April 2002.
At that time, leaders of the five states could not achieve mutual understanding on all issues, but concrete directions of further work were outlined.
A significant progress has been made in the negotiations process on the legal status of the Caspian Sea over these years.
We hope, this meeting will embody a new stage in the development of pentalateral ties, which will ensure stability and stimulate economic and cultural progress, fruitful interaction and mutual trust, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
Kazakhstan’s President underscored the special importance of the main document, the Convention on the legal status of the Caspian Sea, which together with other international acts will regulate the major issues of cooperation between the Caspian littoral states.
We think existing mechanism of quota distribution, when Iran takes 45 percents of salmon catch, Russia – 27, and Kazakhstan together with Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan share remaining 28 percents, does not meet today’s realities, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
The Head of State noted Kazakhstan adheres to its policy of ensuring good-neighbor relationships in the region of the Caspian Sea.
That is confirmed by Kazakhstan’s initiative in the project of the Summit’s Declaration on establishing foundations for strengthening trust, security and stability in the Sea’s region.

Remarks by President Nursultan Nazarbayev at the International Conference Titled From a Nuclear Test Ban to a Nuclear Weapon-Free World
speeches and addresses
Dear friends!
Today the world has been marking for the third time the observation of the International Day against Nuclear Tests.
The Day was established by the UN General Assembly resolution, which was presented at the initiative of Kazakhstan, the first country in history to have closed the nuclear test site on its territory.
This historical act made by the will of the people of our country 21 years ago has great civilization significance.
In this concern I would like to highlight three main points.
First.
It was Kazakhstan’s decisive step towards its real sovereignty and independence.
Nuclear weapons and radiation was far from being a distant theory for the people of Kazakhstan.
It was a terrible and inexorable evil that had been devastating our land for more than four decades.
A total of nearly 500 nuclear explosions of the so-called peaceful purposes were carried out in the atmosphere, underground and above ground on the test site.
This is half of all the tests carried out in the world during the existence of nuclear weapons.
Day-to-day radiation poisoned steppes, rivers and lakes, slowly destroying all life around.
The Nuclear Devil caused harmful damages to more than one and a half million of people who lived around the test site.
The tragic consequences of nuclear testing are felt to this day.
Broad popular movement to support my initiatives against nuclear tests gave me confidence and energy in promoting the interests of the people.
Despite the tough confrontation of the Soviet leadership and the military-industrial complex, I signed the decree to close the test site.
Second.
The 29th of August has become the starting point in the process of acquiring by the whole Central Asia of the status of a nuclear-free zone region.
Kazakhstan voluntarily renounced the world’s fourth largest nuclear potential, inherited from the Soviet military machine.
It was more than 110 ballistic missiles with 1200 nuclear warheads, able to reach any point on the earth.
At that time, we often heard opinions that lowered the significance of Kazakhstan’s courageous step.
For example, some people argued that this step was explained by our inability and lack of capacity to support atomic arsenal.
I would like to remind that Kazakhstan is the second largest possessor of uranium reserves in the world and ranks first in its production.
The economic potential of the republic is equal or exceeds the GDP of some threshold countries.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, we had both specialists and necessary infrastructure to conduct military nuclear programs.
Therefore, two decades ago the emergence of a new nuclear power in the name of Kazakhstan was only a matter of political will and time.
But we showed political will and unconditionally withdrew from the membership in the Nuclear Club.
In cooperation with the United States and Russia we eliminated the warheads and bombs.
In September 2006, together with other countries we signed the Semipalatinsk Treaty, which declared Central Asia a nuclear-free zone.
Third.
The closure of the Semipalatinsk test site launched a new stage of the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament process.
Before August 29, 1991 mainly restrictive measures on nuclear safety had been taken.
Kazakhstan was the first to accomplish the act of complete and unconditional ban on the testing and on the development of weapons of the judgment day.
Sixteen years ago, by the UN decision the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was opened for signature.
And Kazakhstan was among the first to join it.
Now 183 countries have already joined the Treaty, and 157 states ratified it.
All the member states of the Nuclear Club observe moratorium on nuclear testing.
The closing of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site was followed by other major test sites of the planet – in Nevada, Novaya Zemlya, Lop Nur and Moruroa.
That is why the 29th of August is a decisive moment that has shifted the danger of nuclear apocalypse for the whole world.
I am confident that with years and decades awareness of the significance of this date of the whole international community will only increase.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
The British magazine the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has been measuring the level of the global nuclear threat by the symbolic Doomsday Clock for sixty five years already.
In the beginning of this year the magazine moved the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock one minute closer to the date of possible nuclear disaster.
Why this decision was made?
The scientists wanted to attract urgent attention of the participants of the Global Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul to the array of problems in this field.
Nowadays we observe the reduction of the global nuclear security strengthening process, even despite the regular summits on this subject.
Firstly, we have not reached the universality of the non-proliferation regime.
New nuclear and some threshold countries are still not included in the Treaty.
Secondly, two years ago, the United States and Russia signed the Prague Treaty which furthered a Strategic Arms Reduction process.
However, this did not become an example for other nuclear-weapon states.
Thirdly, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) can’t come into force.
Signatures of only a few threshold group countries are needed for it to become operative.
Fourthly, the issue of the global monitoring of the development of national nuclear power programs remains unregulated.
The lack of clear unambiguous rules casts a shadow of nuclear ambitions or even of support to nuclear terrorism, on almost any nation that seeks to use the peaceful atom.
This manifested injustice does not promote non-proliferation regime, but breeds mistrust in nuclear safety.
There are concerns that the amendments to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material will not come into force, as planned, in 2014.
The reason for these apprehensions is a stupor in their ratification by a number of countries.
Fifthly. The accident at Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant last year clearly outlined for the whole world the problem of technology gap in ensuring safety at the facilities of peaceful atom.
Here is an incomplete list of issues slowing down the formation of the global nuclear safety system.
But all these are only results, not reasons.
The sources of these problems are deeper.
The drawbacks of the modern global politics, largely inherited from the past epochs influence the current state of the global nuclear safety.
This is the inertia of block thinking, the lack of trust and openness in the relations between the countries, the lack of responsibility of individual states.
The chaotic nature of the objective course of a multi-polar world worsens the situation.
Some politicians and military men are still intoxicated with the opium of military atom.
There are forces in the world, which have a restricted vision of the global multi-polar world, first of all, as a combination of a number of centres of nuclear forces.
I am convinced that there is no place for exotica of nuclear umbrellas in the future.
It is immoral to make the issues on nuclear safety a small coin while solving the other problems of inter-state relations.
And at the same time the twenty-first century is impossible without nuclear power.
According to experts, the needs of the world economy in energy will be doubled by 2035.
Today about 2 billion people on the planet have no access to electricity.
For many countries, the solution of problems of poverty, unemployment, lack of food is related to the implementation of projects of peaceful nuclear energy, of course, under the strict control of the UN and the IAEA.
That is why our idea of a nuclear-free world has nothing to do with the radio phobia or utopian desire to ever forget the secret of energy fission.
The nuclear-free world is a complete ban on the military use of nuclear energy.
This is the essence of my proposal on the development and adoption of the Universal Declaration of a nuclear-free world.
I remain a consistent supporter of this idea.
Distinguished participants of the conference!
From the standpoint of political realism it is necessary to recognize that the solution of key problems of the global nuclear security can not be separated from the general process of transformation of the modern world order.
Recently, speaking at the Astana Economic Forum, I called to form a new world order in the format and on the principles of G-GLOBAL.
Acquiring of freedom from the fear of nuclear self-destruction should become an important initiative of the G-GLOBAL forum.
I am confident that the breakthrough in the global nuclear safety is also possible on the basis of five principles proposed by the G-GLOBAL.
First.
A step-by-step plan of comprehensive arms reduction with participation of all nuclear states that should be drawn out and adopted by the UN is necessary.
First of all, the nuclear test ban treaty should be entered into force.
It is important to work out mechanisms of promotion of states that had cancelled their military nuclear programs.
But we have to do it gradually.
For example, we can use the practice of rejecting modernization and deactivate obsolete nuclear warheads and means of delivery.
The work should be obviously done along the process of nuclear disarmament carried out by the nuclear-weapon states - the United States and Russia.
The measures to curtail the nuclear umbrellas are further seen realistic.
It is a question about the restriction of placing and storage of nuclear weapons only outside the national territory of the state, possessing them.
Second.
Strong international security guarantees to all participants of regional nuclear-free zones are very important.
It is necessary to develop mechanisms to encourage states which principally refused from nuclear weapons programs.
The problems associated with the prospects of nuclear power in some countries can be solved only on this basis.
To date, 30 states have taken national commitments in the field of nuclear safety.
The international anti-nuclear law and practical politics should not have double standards and exceptions.
Third.
Nuclear disarmament and nuclear-free world is unthinkable without the trust of all parties involved in this process.
The principle of trust is a reasonable alternative to the military concept of deterrence, including nuclear ones.
In a month we will mark the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan's initiative on the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia.
The CICA today is a developing promising structure for regional and global security.
It brings together 27 states with half of the world's population and produces more than a third of the global output.
The successful development of the CICA shows that in the twenty-first century the issues arising in relations between the states can be constructively resolved only on the basis of trust.
The global nuclear security system should use the potential of the regional structures such as the CICA, the OSCE, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and others.
Therefore, it is necessary to expand their baskets with the issues on formation of a nuclear-free world.
Offering the idea of the G-GLOBAL, I called the global tolerance one of the fundamental principles of the new world order.
Unfortunately, we are still observing false messages to reinforce any religion by the power of nuclear weapons.
Let me remind you that 20 years ago Kazakhstan firmly rejected the advice of some well-wishers and the dubious honor to become the first Muslim nuclear power.
Nuclear weapons are suicidal for humanity.
Suicide as a direct challenge is proscribed by all regions of the world.
And from this point of view aspiration for possession of nuclear weapons power is an absolute blasphemy.
A nuclear-free world is our common goal to which the humanity should aspire.
Only by acting together, we can make our world safer and better.
We have the opportunity to remind the world once again of the tragic consequences of nuclear testing, to encourage the global community to more decisive actions on complete and unalterable prohibition.
For this reason, today Kazakhstan is launching its international project called ATOM.
The name of the project ATOM is an acronym formed of the first four letters in the English language which reads as Abolish Testing. Our Mission.
As part of this project, any person in the world who stands against nuclear weapons can sign the petition to the world’s governments online to call for a complete ban of nuclear tests and thus, to facilitate a sooner adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
I call the participants of the conference and all the people of the world to support ATOM project and make building of a nuclear weapons-free world our most important goal.
Fourth.
I see the global transparency as one of the foundations of the future nuclear-free community of nations.
Kazakhstan through its antinuclear experience has demonstrated to the whole world the power of openness in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
Recently, in transparent manner, we carried out the project of transportation of 210 tons of spent nuclear fuel to a safe storage.
And we continue transparent work on the transferring Kazakh reactors to low-enriched fuel.
With the IAEA a unique automated system of accounting, control and physical protection of natural uranium is being created.
The work on Kazakhstan's bid in the IAEA to place in our country the International Nuclear Fuel Bank has been carried out already at the practical level.
All these are examples of unconditional benefits for our country, which abandoned nuclear weapons.
And it is also an example for other states.
Fifth.
The movement to the nuclear free world is the way to constructive multilateralism.
Positive cooperation for the sake of security of the mankind demonstrates involvement of many countries in the work of transforming the former Semipalatinsk nuclear test site to the territory of peace.
The high level of cooperation on this issue between Kazakhstan, Russia and the United States was marked in the joint statement of Presidents of the three countries, adopted during the Seoul Global Nuclear Security Summit.
Japan, Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and a number of international organizations significantly contributed to the various rehabilitation projects.
We are grateful to all for this help.
Many different programs of the United Nations play an important role in overcoming the effects of nuclear testing.
Two years ago, Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon personally visited the area of the former Semipalatinsk nuclear test site.
I am thankful for his support and high appreciation of the anti-nuclear policy and initiatives of Kazakhstan.
Today, the humanity has a unique chance to get away from the endless brink of nuclear collapse.
And for that, more than ever it is important to bring together all nations and all people of good will!
Parliamentarians from all countries of the world are present at the conference today.
That is why this forum can be called a prototype of the global antinuclear parliamentary assembly.
I suggest considering the establishment of such international public institute.
Moreover, I would like to attract attention of the participants to the G-GLOBAL Internet forum call upon to actively participate in the interactive discussion under the G-GLOBAL format.
Within the framework of this format millions of users have a dialogue on a wide range of issues on formation in the twenty-first century a new, fair world order.
I have no doubt that an important component of this order will be a nuclear-free world.
I call upon you to actively participate in the interactive discussion under the G-GLOBAL format and to work for nuclear-free world for our future and for the future of our grandchildren.

Events
The President delivered a speech named Development of human resources is the main value of independence.
In the terms of human life, 16 years is the age of maturity, at which people are issued passports and have full social responsibility.
Today, we can confidently say Kazakhstan in its 16 years of independent development became a full, responsible and respectable citizen of the world community, the President said in his speech.
Kazakhstan’s economy could overcome the system crisis after the collapse of the Soviet Union and cope with difficulties of the Asian financial crisis in 1998, and now it is experiencing consequences of a new world crisis.
However, because of the correct economic strategy, National Fund, gold and currency reserves we can easily overcome and dampen the cyclic recession of the world economy and ensure stable economic growth in our country.
Today, the country’s gold and currency reserves including assets of the National Fund are worth about 40 billion dollars.
Starting from 2000, our economy has been enjoying an annual growth of 9-10% of GDP.
This year, the country’s GDP per capita is greater than 7 thousand dollars.
Deposits in the local banks are equal to 3.5 trillion tenges.
The growth of pension savings in the local accumulating funds has exceeded 1.1 trillion tenges.
In accordance with the Strategy for industrial innovative development, manufacturing is growing in all regions of the country.
New enterprises are built every year.
Literally several days ago, a modern electrolyze plant having designed capacity of 250 tons of aluminum per year was completed in Pavlodar.
A plant producing seamless steel pipes of world quality was also built there.
Ten thousand jobs were created only at these two plants.
For the first time, assembly plants manufacturing cars and tracks were established in Kazakhstan.
The Shar-Ust Kamenogorsk railroad was completed this year.
The first train of the Zhanazhol gas processing plant having capacity of 6 billion cubic meters of gas per year was completed in Aktubinsk.
In summer 2008, Tengizchevroil will complete a plant of second generation.
This will allow increasing oil extraction by 12 million tons.
In the nearest future, we will build tens of new industrial objects.
Agriculture is also actively developing.
The volume of agricultural production has been almost tripled over the last ten years.
The country’s grain growers demonstrated especially impressive figures.
Kazakhstan now occupies the first position in terms of grain production and export per capita.
In this regard, the President congratulated all agriculturists on accomplishments of this year and noted that a large group of rural area workers received state awards.
Because of your work, the country has reliable warranties of food security, and at the same time, Kazakhstan strengthens its positions in the world food markets, the President said.
In his speech, the President put an emphasis that in the years of independence the state’s major objective was to build a socially oriented economy and maintain the well-being of its citizens.
Because of that, it was possible to form an effective model of human resources development and lay foundations of the Kazakhstani living standards.
Only over the last ten years, the state’s expenditures on education, science, culture, public health care and social protection that determine the quality of human resources have increased by 8.7 times.
From 1997, the minimum wage has increased by more than 4.5 times; the mean nominal salary has increased from 8.5 thousand tenges up to 50.8 thousand tenges, in other words, by 6 times.
In the last years, Kazakhstan has been a leader among all CIS countries in terms of mean salary.
On the whole, expenditures on social care increased by 3 times in comparison with the same figures of the late ninetieths, and will reach 545 billion tenges in 2008.
Kazakhstan has been persistently abiding by principles of socially oriented economy and deserved the reputation of a socially responsible state.
In the nearest future, we must set new higher standards in social area.
All people of our country must make their contribution to the further development of the economy to make this real.
We can spend only earned money on social needs, Nursultan Nazarbayev underscored.
The President called issues of public health care to be of key priority.
Our goal is to make Kazakhstan a healthy nation.
This is a prerequisite of its competitiveness.
Over the last decade, state expenditures on public health care have increased by 13 times and are equal now to 338.5 billion tenges.
From 1991, 290 objects of public health care, hospitals, and ambulatories were built and reconstructed.
that claimed more than 100 billion tenges.
Over the last five years, facilities of primary medical organizations have been tripled.
In 2007-2011, 151 medical objects and 300 standard ambulatories will be built in the rural area.
The main objective of these actions in the area of medicine is to open the country to cutting-edge achievements of medical sciences and technologies, new ideas and methods.
We must invest in innovations in medicine as we do in other areas, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized.
The President also put an emphasis on the progress made in the education area over the years of independence.
In these years, 388 schools were built, because the state financing of education increased by 6.7 times over the last decade.
By 2009, additional 240 schools costing 136 billion tenges will be built.
We do targeted work on restoring kindergartens.
About 95% of schools in Kazakhstan including those in the rural area are connected to the Internet.
Despite of the difficulties of the ninetieths, the President initiated the Bolashak program that annually sends three thousands of young Kazakhstani students abroad to study.
Starting from 2000, the financing of science in Kazakhstan has increased by 7 times.
By 2012, we plan to allocate three times greater funds on developing science and applied technologies.
Hence, today all conditions are being created for achieving high living standards in Kazakhstan.
As you can see, our progress is impressive.
But this must not cause euphoria and carelessness.
We have got many problems and difficulties and a lot of work to do in order to improve social conditions of people having low incomes, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
The President also noted that the year of the 16th anniversary of independence will be a year of radical political transformations and fundamental constitutional reforms in the history of Kazakhstan.
The strengthened role of parliament and political parties, independence of the judicial power, enforcement of maslikhats, development of local self-governing, new functions of the Assembly of the people of Kazakhstan, enforced protection mechanisms of civil rights in the judicial system and many other reforms have moved our country toward democracy.
A number of amendments and additions were made to the Constitution of the country that transformed Kazakhstan from presidential to presidential parliamentary republic.
For the first time in the history of independent Kazakhstan, parliamentary elections were held according to proportional system.
The Nur Otan Party had a convincing victory at the recent elections. The party formed the government and thousands of its members actively participate in the implementation of their pre-election pledges.
I believe Nur Otan will implement not only the program for raising living standards, but also the main tasks of the Strategy 2030 aimed at building a competitive, successful and prosperous country, the President noted.
In his speech, Nursultan Nazarbayev put a special emphasis on the most important achievement of our country in this year, the decision made by 56 countries to offer Kazakhstan the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2010.
At the same time, Kazakhstan is the first CIS country, the first Turkish language country, the first country historically belonging to the Islamic civilization area and the first Asian country that will chair the OSCE.
By supporting our bid for chairing the OSCE, the member countries of this organization unanimously confirmed the correctness of the course of our strategic development and its accordance with world trends.
By making this decision, the world community positively evaluated Kazakhstan’s efforts on building democratic state, developing civil society and also political reforms conducted this year, Nursultan Nazarbayev underscored.

Akorda – the residence of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Sovereign Kazakhstan’s new capital has a unique architectural ensemble in terms of artistic meaning and scale.
An important element of the city’s central area is Akorda – the residence of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The residence is a compositional and conceptual centre of the city’s architecture.
The key points of Astana’s design axis are: Khan Shatyr – Bayterek – Akorda – The Palace of Peace and Accord – Kazak Eli.
This composition visually embodies the ideas of preserving the continuity of the Great steppes’ traditions, promotion of Eurasian culture of tolerance and creation of strong Kazakhstan that aspires to achieve heights of the modern world civilization.
Akorda is one of the visible images of the country’s new philosophy of development.
The symbolical and functional designation of the residence was fully reflected in the design of front facades and interiors, in their stylistic and a colour scheme.
The building’s design that is traditional for the European architecture has been given new features.
By its concept and realization Akorda embodies the image of Kazakhstan’s independence.
Kazakh and eastern motifs in the palace’s architectural decoration are expressed by a theme of circles and ornamental decor.
The project’s distinctive feature and its exclusive is a unique collection of Kazakh fine arts works that contributes to the residence’s stylistic wholeness.
Metaphorically it reflects a steppe civilization in the mirror of the European culture, a synthesis of arts of the planet’s largest continent - Eurasia.
The aesthetic system of the building’s external shape and interiors harmoniously goes back to best samples of the traditional European architecture.
The works of the Kazakhstani artists exhibited at the residence make up the very balance of the western and eastern cultures Kazakhstan is proud of while positioning itself as a state that unites cultures of great civilizations.
The residence’s construction began in 2001.
The authors aimed to create an unrepeatable, unique complex which would symbolize power and dynamism of the swiftly developing country.
Well-known architects of Europe and Kazakhstan were involved in the project.
Among them were renowned European designers M.Gualazzi and A.Molteni.
The interiors in national style were produced according to the academician K.Montakhayev’s expert opinion.
Experts and workers of 26 nationalities and from ten countries of the world worked on construction of the major state building.

The area in front of Akorda accentuates stateliness of the main facade.
The solemn atmosphere is created by the fountain and flower paths.
The approach and asphalt paths, landscape architectural elements, parking zones fit well into the composition.
The territory is enclosed by a decorative fencing with illumination.
The name of the Head of state’s residence has a deep symbolic significance.
When translated directly Akorda means the White headquarters.
The white colour and light tones prevail in the colour scheme of facades and residence interiors.
In the semantics of the Turkic culture white primarily means sacred (sacral).
This notion embodies joy and well-being, sincerity and nobleness, honour and good.
The white colour’s rich symbolism was reflected in Akorda’s architectural design.
This primarily relates to the colour scheme of its basic interiors.
The white colour as the basic and leading one is present in a multitude of shades - from white to ivory.
